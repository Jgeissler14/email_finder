Created, from scratch, VB Software + SQL Server DB that pulls very detailed survey data from an external data aggregator company through a custom ETL data migration process. My custom software organizes the survey data and text into a logical customer oriented view and then exports it, with one click, into an easily readable Excel spreadsheet. My custom software reduced the work time for this from TWO MDavis employees working 8 hours manually, to create the reports, down to only TWO minutes.

We have 60 employees spread out between Waltham, MA, Tampa, FL, East Hartford, CT, Hamilton, NJ, & Elmhurst Ill 

► 2006 to present – CEO. In this role, I am in charge of forecasting, equipment budgeting, strategic planning & implementation of the new ERP.  I also manage the national sales & accounting teams. We support a national contract with the biggest Environmental consulting firm in the world & also hold two EPA emergency response contracts in New England & New Jersey/NY/MD/PA.  

Since assuming this position, I have completely reengineered the company’s structure to provide better customer service & enforce accountability at the departmental level.  By separating focus by Air, Water, Soil, & Wireless devices, we have developed a defined corporate structure enabling site directors to manage the staff more effectively & be more responsive to our client’s needs.
As a result of this & other efforts, we have doubled the company's revenue since 2006.  

As part of the restructuring, I am implementing new software technology to automate many of our activities & significantly reducing our expenses. As a byproduct, we have been able to provide the ability to give clients real-time data on inventory commitment which will save each office huge savings in man hours researching inventory.

► 1996 to 2006 – National Sales Manager. I was responsible for new business development as well as current client retention. During this period, I opened three new offices in CT, FL, and IL.

If you rent environmental sampling equipment or ever need to monitor for fugitive particulates or dust in construction sites or are just unhappy with your current vendor for Environmental sampling equipment and safety supplies I hope you will give us a call.

"Redi-Direct","Redi-Direct",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"true","Redi-Data, a division of Redi-Direct, is a list provider specializing in healthcare data.  Redi-Data receives, enhances, and processes data for Physician, Nurse, Pharmacists, Dentists, Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners.  We specialize in both postal and email lists with an in-house mail shop and email deployment services.  Each month we process over 200 million postal records and deploy millions of emails for our customers.  

As Director of Data Services, I oversee all incoming data, and the procedures around the processing of that data.  Procedures include: Postal Process of all files through BCC Postal software, deceased processing, validation of data and consolidation of duplicate records.  Redi-Data compiles email addresses from many sources which all must be validated and matched to our base files.  These sources come at different times including daily data from our deployment services.  As the hands-on Director, I lead a team in the development and executing of these processing.

As Director of Web Applications, I design, built and support web systems which allow users to select the segment of data they want to market to.  For Redi-Data email marketing services we maintain multiple deployment systems, domains, and IP addresses.  A key element of my job involves these systems ensuring they are setup correctly and healthy to produce the best response and delivery rates.  The team I oversee included web programmers in NJ and India.  In NJ the team includes customer service employees specialized in postal and email campaigns.

Being Director of Web Applications and Data Services keeps me involved in the full cycle of our work from incoming data, applications, deployments, technical sales support, and customer service. The execution and operations of these area has direct impact on the company revenue.  Working for 15 years for Redi-Direct family of companies has been a source of pride and accomplishment for me.","1","9","2008","7","16","7","16","Director of Web Applications and Data Services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Peter","Peter Brooks","Director of Web Applications and Data Services","Brooks","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAABgXHgBu7ofaxth2Nx33KlhRYd2eK19cs8","","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList((text%3Adata%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=9PNl7cxBQ1ujpkMn4abDeg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"

LDP has allowed me to grow my knowledge and experience as the company has been called on to assist with data center design and construction from small enterprise to large scale Tier 4 colo providers. LDP has enjoyed double digit growth for over a decade as the company is continually growing into new regions. 

As a Regional Director for LDP I assist the southern California team with detecting, managing and implementing data center projects.

Our industry for too long lacked single open standards that would identify Entities and Instruments.  I wrote about this in 2001 after convening an industry working group to address Unique Security Identification, and that paper is still referenced today throughout the industry in its original form.  

In September 2014, the Object Management Group (www.omg.org) officially accepted FIGI as a global  open standard. In 2021, FIGI became a US National Standard, accredited by ANSI/X9.

The Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI; \'fig - ē\) provides an open, unique, non changing identifier for instrument (product/asset/security, etc) identification.

It took the 2008 credit crisis to make any movement on LEI.  But, with the creation of the LEI (Legal Entity Identifier), half of this problem was addressed.  With the creation of the FIGI, the second half of the equation is finally provided.

I am working towards educating the industry on how FIGI can help individual firms, and the industry as a whole, enable better data management and quality, improve communication with and between organizations, reduce costs and improve the information we use for critical decision making.

Instrument identification has been a hap-hazard collection of schemes that fit a specific functional need or purpose.  Depending on where you are in the trade process, what you are doing, decisions you have to make, or who you need to communicate with, will influence what scheme (or schemes) may be appropriate.  And even then, it may not be readily apparent, there are challenges of open versus closed 'standards', redistribution and 'ownership' questions.  

Let us show you how properly leveraging the FIGI can cut through these issues and let you get back to focusing on using your data to work for your business - not trying to figure out how to get data to work.","1","3","2015","1","10","1","10","Chief Strategist, Open Data and Standards",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Richard","Richard Robinson","Chief Strategist, Open Data and Standards","Robinson","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAA6aWoB44zOjLVspHXJAMKr51vn6GldCj4","https://www.linkedin.com/company/2494","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList((text%3Adata%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=9PNl7cxBQ1ujpkMn4abDeg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"

While the TLV Charities organization has increased in size, and the number of events, as we have evolved over the years, the focus of our core initiative has never strayed from raising the most exposure awareness and financial support.

“TLV Charities” came from the concern that simply writing a check and forgetting about the genuine need of a cause somehow replaced actual volunteering. While a monetary donation is always important and much appreciated, getting people actively involved in the community is essential to an organization’s prosperity.

The goal of our organization is to give back to the community through fun and creative ways that also help promote and encourage others to become and remain active in their communities.","1","10","2015","6","9","6","9","Executive Board",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Shannon","Shannon Clements","Executive Board","Clements","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAABeijWwB1fYkJ-zX8j8ik8VixcTElD5Dm4A","https://www.linkedin.com/company/10696946","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList((text%3Adata%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=9PNl7cxBQ1ujpkMn4abDeg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"

I am at the forefront of transforming our installation’s capabilities e.g., meteorology, manned and unmanned aircraft.  My mission is clear: drive the cultural and technological revolution necessary to defend against our adversaries in the digital age and ensure the Army meets its mission with cutting-edge capabilities.

•	Drive Strategic Policy Impact
I proudly drafted ATEC’s enterprise-wide policies for Data Storage and for Data Retention, shaping the framework for all T&E Commands. These policies directly impact over $500 million in projects and more than 8,500 military, civilian, and contract personnel.

•	Champion and Navigate Impactful Organizational Changes
I lead efforts to help personnel understand that transformation is more than technology—it is about people. I guide leaders, division directors, and chiefs through complex, high-stakes transitions that affect not only workloads but also morale.

Having served in Army Community Service (ACS), supporting Soldiers and their families through PTSD recovery, suicide prevention, sexual harassment and assault response, financial readiness, and relocation challenges, I deeply understand the human side of change. I have helped lead cultural shifts within organizations managing up to $11 billion budgets and 60,000 personnel.

•	Drive Innovation & Upskilling of the Workforce
I provided critical advisory and troubleshooting support to departments enabling them to leverage AI-driven tools such as Power BI, Power Automate, AI-assisted document drafting, and advanced data flows.

•	Teach and Exemplar Leadership in Excellence Skills
My presence and leadership are not just about modernizing systems—it is about redefining how we think, operate, and execute in a world driven by technology to excel above our enemies!  My global experience e.g., Africa, US states, and Washington D.C. brings a lot to the table.","1","8","2024","8",,"8",,"Deputy Chief Data and Analytics Office (D-CDAO) - Data Scientist",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Dr. Charlene","Dr. Charlene Coon","Deputy Chief Data and Analytics Office (D-CDAO) - Data Scientist","Coon","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAqqbCQBNxNcbd0NEZoO1Xh_tOm8D8_V_B0","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1223","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList((text%3Adata%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=9PNl7cxBQ1ujpkMn4abDeg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"

• Manage development and deployment of policies, processes, and technology to reduce compliance risk and security exposure
• Improve the availability, understanding, and accuracy of Gannett Enterprise Data to all data Citizens
• Implement a Data Culture across the enterprise
• Reduce data silos, data confusion, and effort required to utilize enterprise data
• Implement AI Governance processes to reduce risk and improve revenue by using advanced technology

Our Data Governance Office leverages a small team of skilled Data Governance, Data Quality, Data Engineering, Data Architecture, Data Visualization, Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Business Stewards and many other professional roles to develop and govern an Enterprise Business Glossary with business terms, acronyms, measures, KPIs, and catalogs of applications and 3rd party vendors related together for added value. We have developed MDM and Reference Data governance solutions integrating our Enterprise Data Catalog tool from Collibra and our Data Lake Google BigQuery. We have designed and implemented an Enterprise Report Inventory and associated Report Certification Process to increase the quality and trust of our enterprise reports used in critical decision making. We are actively engaged in AI Governance process design and tooling to manage risk assessments of AI and ML projects using OneTrust and Collibra.

Our Data Governance Office coordinates with various stakeholders to enrich and govern the metadata of our enterprise and critical data sources, systems, and assets. 

Our program is overseen by a Data Governance Steering Committee with senior executives and data leaders from multiple data domains.","1","7","2022","9","2","9","2","Director Data Governance & Strategy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Brian","Brian Lloyd","Director Data Governance & Strategy","Lloyd","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAH0t_kBWfacko_tdu6UYmzAfsA1BXAdqJM","https://www.linkedin.com/company/4191","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList((text%3Adata%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=9PNl7cxBQ1ujpkMn4abDeg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"

☛ 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦… 
The security software company had recently acquired another large software maker. Part of the acquisition was to absorb many of the data centers owned by the acquired company. 

After the acquisition was complete, they learned that the leases in 49 data centers in Europe, Asia, North America, Australia, and the Middle East were set to expire in 2 months time. 

They had limited site information but had to be out of the Colo facilities in order to avoid penalties.


☛ 𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐬
Brass Valley was engaged to coordinate the data center closures. We developed a comprehensive plan to close data centers based on their lease expiration and estimated equipment value. 

We coordinated everything. The deinstallation activities, data destruction, recycling, and resale of all the equipment.

☛ 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐭 - 𝐚𝐧 𝐮𝐧𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐬𝐮𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬!
Brass Valley completed the project on time and under budget. 

In addition, because of the residual value in the equipment, we were able to return $1.2M to the customer at the completion of the project!

For more than 20 years we have lived at the interface of materials, where surface quality and integrity can make or break a product—or a company.

My primary work involves leveraging machine learning techniques to predict forest health trends, land cover changes, and environmental impacts using satellite data.

I process and analyze geospatial data, such as Landsat imagery, by performing tasks like image classification, change detection, and spatial analysis to uncover meaningful patterns. I also develop predictive models to forecast forest conditions, utilizing advanced statistical and machine learning methods.

Additionally, I design and implement interactive data visualizations to present these complex datasets in an accessible way for stakeholders.

Technologies and tools I am using, learning, and harnessing:

Google Earth Engine (JavaScript): For satellite data processing and analysis.

JavaScript​: Used within Google Earth Engine to implement geospatial data analysis and scripting.

SQL: For managing and querying geospatial databases.

Python: For data manipulation, machine learning, automation tasks, and API access to imagery data from Google Earth Engine.

At the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS), we're embarking on an ambitious journey to revolutionize public health insurance access through the One Health initiative. The goal is to streamline and unify the eligibility and enrollment processes for both MAGI and non-MAGI members, transitioning from the legacy MA21 mainframe system to a modern, modular, and more efficient framework.

Key Responsibilities:

-Project Leadership: Spearheading the technical efforts to migrate the MA21 mainframe system (ADABAS/Natural) to the AWS Cloud. This critical step is foundational for the larger goal of modernizing public health insurance access.
-Strategic Planning: Collaborating in the development of EOHHS's strategic plan. This involves an in-depth analysis of the current Medicaid and MA21 operations, pinpointing areas for innovation and improvement.
-System and Operations Mapping: Leading a comprehensive effort to map and understand the existing Medicaid and MA21 systems and operations, setting the stage for their successful transition to the cloud.
-Technical Architecture Management: Overseeing the implementation of technical solutions across various domains - including business processes, systems integration, hardware, and networking - to ensure a seamless and effective migration of the MA21 system to the AWS Cloud.
-Lead Author of RFQ & RFR for the Rehosting Vendors

Impact:

This initiative marks a pivotal step towards the One Health vision, offering a single point of access for individuals and families seeking public health insurance benefits. By modernizing the legacy system, we're not only enhancing efficiency but also ensuring more robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure for future expansions.","1","10","2023","6","1","6","1","Senior Technical Cloud Project Manager",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Eric","Eric Hayslett","Senior Technical Cloud Project Manager","Hayslett","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAClvN4BhJZYxdST5lCemf9SB9EhLDvraO4","https://www.linkedin.com/company/10866537","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList((text%3Adata%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=9PNl7cxBQ1ujpkMn4abDeg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"

Our team spent years talking to top professionals about what was working, and what was broken, in their business relationships and communities. What we found was an industry in need of a major update — one stuck in the trading-business-cards age of networking, offering little more than superficial relationships and benefits.

So we set out to create something different. Leaning on YEC’s deep understanding of community building and Forbes’ global reach and resources, we’ve created a space for exceptional business owners and leaders to come together with the people and resources that can help them thrive.

Through our selection process, we recruit and invite members not just on the basis of career success, but on their diversity of perspective and willingness to give as much as they gain. We bring these members together in communities tailored to their industry or region — see a full list of Forbes Councils here — so that they can connect with others best positioned to help them overcome challenges and create new opportunities.

Finally, we provide members with a growing list of support benefits that help them save time and money, and a platform, CommunityVoice on Forbes.com, through which they can amplify their voices and exchange ideas.

At Forbes Councils, we believe that behind each of the world’s most successful business owners and leaders is a strong community of support","1","6","2019","10","5","10","5","Agency Member",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Sammy","Sammy S.","Agency Member","S.","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAABy6OicBzywkixvvy0Hx9dfyc5mK_904Xzs","https://www.linkedin.com/company/5597","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList((text%3Adata%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=9PNl7cxBQ1ujpkMn4abDeg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"

WHY IT MATTERS: Electronics recycling goes hand-in-hand with IT managed services.  When followed properly, legacy IT resale programs can fund additional IT spending.

MY STORY: Started 30+ years ago in Jersey City, NJ buying and selling computer parts during the internet boom.  Y2K scare emerged & enterprise IT needed a plan for retiring old IT equipment.   

Established customized E-Waste, Trade-In,  & Information Technology Asset Management Programs (ITAM) for both Government & Private Sector clients. 

This solution development builds loyalty and long-term commitments from customers.  
   
We work with enterprise Data Center operations ensuring best practices in Department of Defense Certified Data Destruction (5220.22M) & Disposal.  These electronics recycling best practices are leveraged by many data center maintenance and IT service providers.  

WHO I AM: Author of published white papers on IT recycling & re-marketing.  Awarded Channel Champion, Congressional Recommendation for IT recycling & secure DoD compliant data destruction.

Data 360 provides a low-code app development platform as a service to help businesses large and small build their software in the cloud, using AI and machine learning to lower the cost of developing and managing websites, social media, mobile apps, CRM systems, and ERP systems. Our enterprise services also work with organizations in education, healthcare, retail and restaurant industries. Our system can save up to 90% of operational costs for any type of organization.

We have two main services in our development platform, Smart Search and Smart CRM.  Data 360's Smart Search service uses big data, AI and machine learning to replace traditional market research, customer research or any other data-driven information gathering.   Our Smart CRM service provides a matching system using big data, AI and machine learning that helps clients recruit and manage the most appropriate contacts for any operations, HR, marketing or sales goal.

We're solving for the problems of inefficiency and high costs human error and bias in the creation of web, SaaS and mobile based software systems for developing, growing and managing communities (including customers, employees, partners and collaborators).  We're a cloud-based backend system that is a low cost, high value alternative to the high costs of managing these operational processes through traditional web-based platforms, websites and mobile apps, Google ads, Facebook ads, CRM systems and ERP systems.

Our system also creates major positive disruptions for education, healthcare, workforce development, diversity and inclusion (including neurodiversity), work from home (WFH), and human resources (for expanding hiring pipelines).

We enable Web3 audience owners to instantly launch a full-featured branded DeFi trading platform with a shared liquidity network. The only DeFi platform with true network effects built-in by design.

We are unlocking the monetization of trading for all Web3 brands with an existing audience. It disrupts the status quo where brands with a Web3 user base have no alternative but to send their users elsewhere when they need trading services.

Trading services are no longer differentiated. They are generic. From Binance or FTX, to the last exchange in a list of hundreds - trading services are practically the same. Uniswap/Sushiswap/""WhateverSwap"", almost all the same.
Web3 brands, collectively, have millions of users who need these generic trading services, either for general trading or to trade the specific token of brands they use. Yet these brands cannot provide such basic trading services, as it requires sophisticated DeFi technologies. It is not their focus or competency to build them. This is what ULTRADE does. It provides the solution for all Web3 brands to spin up an entire DeFi trading platform in minutes, with full branding, enabling them to provide value-add trading services to their users without worrying about the tech. And of course collecting the fees generated under a rev-share with ULTRADE.
And liquidity? It’s all shared. Every whitelabel partner’s users are trading with all the users in the network, with the same shared liquidity. Brands do not need to jumpstart liquidity themselves.","1","3","2022","1","3","1","3","Chief Technology Officer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Roman","Roman Zhukov","Chief Technology Officer","Zhukov","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAATer4Bfniw7AMbfQ8USMsg-hkAqzF1Ny4","https://www.linkedin.com/company/79426259","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList((text%3Adata%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=9PNl7cxBQ1ujpkMn4abDeg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"

I am spearheading a groundbreaking AI transformation that is redefining how defense and army contract RFPs are processed, evaluated, and optimized. My focus is on architecting next-generation AI platforms that operate entirely on-premises, ensuring the highest levels of security, compliance, and efficiency for mission-critical government contracts.

At the core of this innovation is a powerful fusion of state-of-the-art AI technologies—leveraging LLaMA, Grok, and Ollama for generative intelligence, Vector Databases and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for precision document retrieval, and Agentic AI processes to enable dynamic, context-aware decision-making. My expertise spans across deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Python, ensuring the seamless integration of these technologies into an AI-driven ecosystem that automates and optimizes the entire RFP lifecycle.

Beyond technical leadership, I bring strategic AI management expertise, driving adoption, scalability, and cross-functional collaboration to accelerate AI-powered efficiencies in defense procurement. This initiative is not just about automation—it’s about intelligent augmentation, where AI acts as a force multiplier, revolutionizing how the defense sector approaches complex contracting processes.","1","7","2024","9",,"9",,"AI Advisor, Board Member",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Ganesh","Ganesh Raju","AI Advisor, Board Member","Raju","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAABcLBMB0ur_4VivQ5q9AFxl6oOoT10zVHM","https://www.linkedin.com/company/96670793","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList((text%3Adata%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=9PNl7cxBQ1ujpkMn4abDeg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"

Founded by Matthew Bejtlich and Charlotte Hankin in 2024. it is our response to an increasingly ravaged planet, one marked by the epoch ‘Anthropocene’; a planetary boundary marked by human in/action. Charlotte and Matthew feel concern for the future/s of all life on this planet and seek out hope-full, generative and imaginative responses to attend-to, heal, provoke, agitate, conjure up alternative ways of living (and dying) together. 

Unfolding Aliveness is a space for like-minded people to come together, to share stories, create art, listen, learn, and give back through varied expressions of communion with others. Together, we might inspire new ways of noticing our strange, mysterious and beautiful world/s and write new narratives that are co-authored by many and not just the few.
