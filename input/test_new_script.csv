"As a transformational CIO, I thrive on driving significant business value and create a competitive edge. Currently, as Head of IT at Redaptive, I'm spearheading a comprehensive AI strategy that will redefine our company's future, laying the groundwork for unprecedented innovation and growth in the rapidly evolving energy efficiency market. My career has been defined by leading organizations through complex transformations, consistently delivering substantial ROI, and building high-performing teams that excel in the face of rapid change.

I believe that AI, automation, and data analytics are the cornerstones of modern business success. Prior to Redaptive, I drove substantial improvements across a variety of industries.  For example at Maxar Technologies, I implemented DevSecOps and CI/CD, enabling a shift from dozens of releases annually to hundreds monthly, dramatically improving time-to-market and sales enablement. At ADT Security Services, my infrastructure transformation improved agent utilization and reduced agent talk time, resulting in over $5M in business value and improved revenue per employee.  Furthermore, I led a 2-year, $20M Capex program at Maxar to modernize infrastructure and drive cloud adoption.  This enabled the processing of two decades of image data, resulting in significant new sales opportunities.

My expertise lies in aligning technology investments with strategic business objectives. I excel at building consensus, managing change, and fostering a culture of innovation. I'm particularly passionate about the responsible and ethical deployment of AI and ensuring that cybersecurity is woven into the fabric of every initiative. With every project I implement layers of cybersecurity and risk management to protect our intellectual property.

I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and staying ahead of the curve in the dynamic tech landscape. I'm eager to connect with fellow leaders, innovators, and anyone passionate about the transformative power of AI and automation. Let's connect and explore how we can build a more sustainable and efficient future together.

This knowledge and experience start with the project leaders and architects, who direct implementations of cloud concepts and best practices to fit applications needs and provide scalability and resilience, while maintaining the performance that on-premises environments have provided.","2 recent posts on Linkedin","77578976","KWB Pathology Associates","77578976","Hospitals and Health Care","Tallahassee, Florida, United States","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQHoPQf2BiUbSQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1638892095772?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=vNoAJOGy5bYHcZdtYQ8DW28sLOV2Rxy6zfG2JIFdVtM","KWB Pathology Associates","9","2024","7",,"7",,"Director of IT and Security",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Jason","Jason White","White","Tallahassee, Florida, United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ACwAACZAiUABQSFRaLAFUc2tzH4rOTvH7GkH15U","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQEuqHbwrvJWOw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1634432079493?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=tz0sQnoLFBIq8Dklx7vrSJ2CtG6Wug5zCdDikbBxDWk","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAACZAiUABQSFRaLAFUc2tzH4rOTvH7GkH15U,NAME_SEARCH,SLJv"

Earned a reputation in many roles as an excellent partner and collaborator across all levels and parts of the organization including product vision, GTM strategy, and financial planning and execution.

A few more things about me: I sold my first software product at age 14 (a simple POS system for a mom-and-pop computer store) and my second at age 16 (a FPR reporting system).

I'm an avid musician and singer.  I've been playing piano and singing since age 7.

It wasn't long before I was changing those games, improving them to my liking and soon after that learned to take iron to bits when I made an interface cable from a design I found on a BBS so I could save my programs to a cassette tape. 

That's what seeded my passion for technology. Over the years it's developed to make me the technician and engineer that I am today and the experiences I've had have taught me a set of professional values that I carry with me every day:

- Think BIG but be sure you also EXECUTE!
- Always do you very best and have fun!
- I did it, you did it- Who cares. The important part is that we WIN!
- Lead by example
- Run towards the fires
- Always work to improve yourself
- Be the calm one

I'm always up to make new professional acquaintances.

My background includes exposure to dynamic industries such as global energy, electrical vehicles and manufacturing, instilling in me a unique perspective on how to drive growth via productizing and enhancing service offerings.

Generating commercial technology outcomes that align with business expectations and strategy is where I excel. I possess a keen awareness of how digital transformation and AI builds the commercialization and operational roadmap for an organization.

Technology is often viewed solely as a cost center, but it does not have to be. By building high-performing teams, embedding a culture of continuous improvement and engaging across the organization, digital and operational technology can facilitate EBITDA growth. I have proven this to be true throughout my career.

Though I specialize in technology, my unique 360-degree perspective of business operations sets me apart from my peers. I do not just deploy solutions to support technology objectives; I provide high-level contributions to advance long-term corporate viability. A business partner approach to the board of directors allows me to nurture cross-functional relationships, build consensus for new initiatives and rally teams around a common goal. 

Known for a “first on the ship, last off the ship” leadership style, I believe in standing side-by-side with my teams as we tackle initiatives with uncharted complexities. Facilitative and intuitive by nature, understanding what drives my teams and giving them the room to thrive is how I garner results.

"🖖Welcome to my profile!
Please, no soliciting…🙏

I’m always excited to connect with professionals passionate about IT, AI, and cybersecurity. I’m here to share insights and engage in meaningful conversations through my posts.

About Me:
I am an innovative IT, AI, and cybersecurity professional with over three decades of experience, working with some of the world’s largest companies. After successfully selling a global datacenter business, I’ve ventured into new opportunities, balancing a leadership role in the healthcare industry while building a research and AI development company on weekends and nights.

I thrive on technology innovation, especially in the world of AI. My 1000 square foot home lab, equipped with a personal mini datacenter, is my playground for cutting edge AI advancements and cybersecurity defenses. This is where I stay at the forefront of the industry by experimenting, learning, and pushing boundaries.

I am passionate about mentoring US military veterans transitioning into IT careers. I also make time to mentor others when I can. Just watch for my posts for announcements.

I believe in building strong foundations through roles like help desk, network engineering, and system administration before moving into specialized areas like cybersecurity or AI research. My approach focuses on long term, sustainable success, avoiding shortcuts. I can be strict with mentees but those who stick it out with me have all become successful peers. Most become executives and CEOs because of my experience passed on to them.

I also share humor, fun real world industry quizzes, and unique insights that make IT and cybersecurity more engaging.

Outside of work, I love sharing stories, diving into stock investment trends, and connecting with others who are curious and driven. Whether it’s tech discussions or life lessons, I’m always eager to exchange ideas.

Thanks for stopping by!

"Over the past 20+ years I have worked as a software developer/engineer/coder, engineering team lead, technical manager, platform architect, VP engineering, and technology executive. As a coder and software thinker I tackle and enjoy the challenges and complexities of architectures, systems, scaling problems, bug chasing (and hopefully prevention in the first place - easier said than done!).  

As an avid chess player I enjoy strategy. Picking the right person for the role or picking the right technology approach, thinking about what will happen in response to your choice, how you will respond, how the opponent will respond (even if the 'opponent' is just the circumstances/limitations, budgetary or otherwise). Making good decisions basically.

Most of all, I always enjoy working with fun, smart, people.

My career path has been as follows:

As a consultant working on PKI systems I built systems for banks and financial institutions, building client-server certificate-based authentication mechanisms (involving innovative browser technologies), X509, mutual-auth SSL, CAs.

Then I was part of a ~20 person engineering team that laid the foundations for Currenex, a currency trading startup that was later acquired for $564mil. I did similar work there, centered on security and integration of external trading platforms.

Moving on to Sony I applied my knowledge of crypto systems in the realm of digital media. For the first 5 years I worked on two video/photo services, a music service and then some products that bridged the gap between physical and digital media. I learned a lot about scalability, complex distributed systems, Java, SQL, audio & video transcoding, DRM, client-side browser technologies.

After Sony I went to the B2B side working on various projects for Verizon Digital Media Services, who were at the time providing infrastructure to media content and technology companies. The three main platforms I was involved with were Edgecast, Uplynk and Volicon. Mainly the latter two. Uplynk is an industry-leading video streaming platform. The unit was sold off by Verizon and is now called Edgio.

After that I was head of Engineering for two major video platforms, first Pluto TV (I joined just before ViacomCBS' acquisition and led Engineering during the period of growth from $100m rev. a year to over a billion). Next I built a video streaming platform from scratch for TelevisaUnivision in under a year. The platform now generates pretty high revenue and works fantastically.

"Hi, I’m Confidence! (I'm not making this up, my parents set me up by giving me such a name.. 😂)

I’m a cybersecurity professional with over a decade of experience helping organizations build secure products and navigate the ever-evolving threat landscape. My work focuses on making security an enabler of innovation—not a roadblock.

I’ve been fortunate to lead teams and initiatives that embed security into every stage of the development process. Whether it’s integrating automated security testing into CI/CD pipelines, or designing strategies that scale with business goals, I love taking on complex challenges and turning them into actionable solutions.

I’m also the author of API Security for White Hat Hackers, an Amazon bestseller that’s helped professionals master API security strategies to defend against modern threats.

Here’s what I bring to the table:
▶️ Deep expertise in application and product security.
▶️ Inspiring leadership experience that includes mentoring teams, building security programs from the ground up, and presenting strategies that align security with business priorities.
▶️ A commitment to staying ahead of the curve and an insatiable desire for knowledge and improvement, demonstrated through certifications like CSSLP, CISSP, etc.
▶️ Deep expertise in secure coding, threat modeling, CI/CD integration, and cloud security (AWS, Azure).
▶️ Experience driving secure-by-design initiatives and scaling application security programs.
▶️ An energetic & charismatic international speaker who can double as an evangelist for your security initiatives or product.

My super power? Excellent communication skills that enables me simplify complex cybersecurity issues, & help organizations innovate with confidence (Pun intended! 😁).

If you’re looking for a security leader to drive your product or application security strategy—or need a consultant to help transform your security posture—I’d love to chat. Let’s connect!

I pay it forward through my non-profit, CyberSafe Foundation which runs CyberGirls Fellowship; Africa’s biggest cybersecurity training and mentorship program for women.

I’m also frequently celebrated. Here's a summary of some of my most recent recognitions:

"With nearly two decades of experience driving technology and operational excellence, I’m dedicated to creating meaningful change at the intersection of people, technology, and growth. As Chief Technology Officer at UrbanSitter, I have the privilege of leading a dynamic team, where our work is more than engineering; it’s about building systems that connect, empower, and enhance lives.

Previously, I co-founded and served as CTO at Fabriq: Stay in Touch, a platform designed to bring people closer and inspire lasting connections. My journey has taken me across diverse roles, from private-sector engineering leadership to serving high-profile clients such as Amazon, Disney, JPMorgan Chase, and the Department of Interior. These experiences have shaped my approach to technology, leadership, and the art of turning ambitious ideas into tangible, impactful products.

As a conscious leader, I believe in creating environments where people feel supported and inspired to bring their authentic selves to work. I’m passionate about personal growth, fostering well-being, and encouraging curiosity as a foundation for both professional and personal development. Through my coaching and writing, I share insights on mindful communication, servant leadership, and how embracing curiosity can transform both individual and team potential.

"tl;dr: Smart Contracts Rule Everything Around Me

Got into crypto when it still meant cryptography and was still classified as a munition by the government.
Went to university for philosophy, because technology changes fast, got a grounding in logic and reason. Picked up a degree in psychology while I was there, because human brains intrude on every thought. Take up game theory & design as a hobby. Went to work in a tech startup munging commercial data, picked up my first ""modern"" language, automated my job so I had more time to study, and rode that camel into a developer position working on back end systems. Did a bunch of web development for myself and failed to launch a crowdfunding service before kickstarter nailed it. Learned about common technical founder mistakes and the startup game. Started attending startup weekends and contracting while working 9-5 and raising kids. Became manager, then IT director, learned management and delegation, back to engineering before I lost my grasp on current tools. A few more startup efforts and then Ethereum came along, promising smart contracts and trustless escrow, re-igniting my crowdfunding fires and turning them toward programmable trust and value transactions. Won the 2018 Yale-New Haven Startup Weekend with a great team I'm still working with. Started doing Dapp development and met lots of great people. Worked to support the local crypto ecosystem with classes, talks, and events through DappDevs. Connected with a payments industry veteran over his idea for a DLT focused company and got busy researching and building... and here we are!

I'm currently enjoying not only developing technological solutions to old problems, but discovering what new value we can unlock with DLT now that we're able to bring private ledger networks right to participants, harnessing new means of B2B interaction.

Strong opinions, loosely held, often about parts of the future people haven't gotten around to thinking about yet.","1 recent post on Linkedin","51682597","CoreChain Technologies","51682597","IT Services and IT Consulting","New Haven, Connecticut, United States","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQEoS-cWtPgPUg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1725481913579/muellerdesign1_logo?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=g4WHNPilmBsxFg15TEmGbbvhbX1Z_wrYVsRATT0IukQ","CoreChain Technologies","4","2019",,"6",,"6","Chief Technology Officer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","RJ","RJ Herrick","Herrick","New Haven, Connecticut, United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ACwAAAN3RV8B5GdE-7GYg3H7xaOQXE8s3ClrSXg","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQHVKiZ4EzO53Q/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1722550729024?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=1eCE74WoTqrdLGOWh3cb-DBb0f3ACQhXdOGj-Uv6sfQ","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAAAN3RV8B5GdE-7GYg3H7xaOQXE8s3ClrSXg,NAME_SEARCH,5Hqm"

"As a forward-thinking Director of IT with 10+ years of experience boosting IT infrastructure stability, I excel at business process optimization, end-to-end product planning and execution, and enterprise solution implementation. I do so by leading technological needs assessment, process automation, system monitoring and integration, and IT security enhancements based on industry standards. 

Here are a few highlights from my career:
- Successfully executed a digital transformation at System Pavers that resulted in the ability to start projects 3 weeks sooner. Resulting in higher close rates and higher customer satisfaction.
- Grew the account base from 3 to 15 at Evolve Partners Inc. by winning profitable partnerships.
- Won executive buy-in for boosting customer satisfaction by 5% by building a centralized outbound call center.

During my time at System Pavers Inc., one of the many innovative efforts I directed involved leading strategic planning for a pricing tool with the aim to enhance data visualization and ensure pricing data consistency across 13 office branches. While doing so, I leveraged cross-functional team leadership skills and built standardized pricing plans.

When I joined System Pavers Inc., the infrastructure design was negatively impacting many areas of operations. After quickly replacing consumer grade equipment with Enterprise solutions and implementing best practices throughout the network, the operations team began to reap the benefits. The deteriorating call quality, which heavily impacted customer service, was immediately resolved.

"Jon is a 20+ year IT and Cybersecurity leader, who finds it a bit awkward to write about himself in the third person, but that seems to be the thing to do in LinkedIn bios.  He has a very broad IT Operations background ranging from Data Centers to Cloud, Corporate IT to Customer-facing services, Infrastructure to DevOps, across many industries.

Over the last decade, Jon is proud to have built and led the IT/Security organizations for two Software Development firms who each reached their goal of growth and acquisition in under 5 years.

Being results-driven, Jon is skilled at implementing efficiencies and optimizations, operationalizing the business while reducing unnecessarily annoying red tape.  Having a proactive mindset, he is excellent at implementing solutions with minimal issues and also digs in to resolve root causes preventing the business from experiencing frustrating recurrences.  Throughout his career, he has been continually recognized as a strong collaborator with the C-Suite, which has resulted in implementing/adapting the appropriate level of IT/Security technologies/processes to enable the businesses to reach their goals.

Jon (he hopes) is known to be a likable, but also a challenging and well respected people manager, striking the appropriate balance to continually build and lead successful teams.

A lifelong learner, Jon holds an MS of IT and enjoys consuming content via podcasts, books, audiobooks, etc on a wide range of topics but favorites are cybersecurity, self-improvement, business strategy, and adventure/memoirs.  A family guy with a wife, son, and daughter, when there are free moments, he tries to get outdoors and move, frequently needing to pretend to enjoy the New England weather of the day.","Recently hired, Shared groups, 2 recent posts on Linkedin","2345405","Device42, A Freshworks Company","2345405","Software Development","West Haven, Connecticut, United States","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQE6HCKSFq047w/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1719256967586/device42_logo?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=mZY3xlJCDfnXRseJTi7e33ldj6iULFv0AIdFnR2LNag","Device42, A Freshworks Company","9","2020","7","4","7","4","Sr. Director, IT",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Jonathan","Jonathan Cote","Cote","Foxborough (Foxboro), Massachusetts, United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ACwAAACv7pYB_eS0ZUdqUUfNQtGfjc0ormXM_G8","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQGuAZ1qPczp5g/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/B4EZVaHpJQGgAY-/0/1740973708949?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=mg1_cbMbh-oWyeUdBVb6xNtxn2JOqUiRyW9CPQGVZgY","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAAACv7pYB_eS0ZUdqUUfNQtGfjc0ormXM_G8,NAME_SEARCH,3Ipk"

1.	Abandoning my dream to become a chemist
2.	Not making it past 12 months as a first-time head of sales

1.	Building the Solutions organization at LaunchDarkly  
2.	Building the support community and forums at CircleCI  
3.	Going from a geeky Linux fan who did not know what the ""cd"" command did to launching an entire data center from scratch at Linode

We partner with our clients in order to provide well crafted software solutions serving business, finance, logistics, test and measurement, science, or whatever other software challenge arise during the course of doing business.  We aim to leave our clients better than we found them, and are especially focused on adding value aligned with our clients’ goals, never letting perfection stand in the way of sufficient.

In my business, we live by the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto [1]. Experienced in making tough decisions when it comes to growing the business, and tougher decisions when it comes to honing that excellent software craftsmanship to market. Our bottom line is to leave our clients better than we found them; our clients' successes are our successes. Better still when that relationship is mutually beneficial. Let us handle your software development best practices so that you can focus on growing your business.

Our ideal client is small or medium sized business that does not necessarily have nor wish to staff a software development team in house. We stand out from the off-shore pretenders by being on-shore, national, and aligned to cultural values that make the United States great.

"Since 2006, I’ve been proud to be part of Tri-State Expedited, contributing to its growth and success in various roles over the years. I started as Director of IT, where I created technology solutions to tackle the unique challenges of the expedited transportation industry. As a co-owner, I worked with a dedicated team to build a strong foundation for the company. Today, as Chief Information Officer, I’m focused on leading Tri-State into the future as part of the Load1 family.

During my time at Tri-State, I also founded C3D0, where I designed, coded, and led the creation of a custom Transportation Management System (TMS). This system was built specifically to meet Tri-State’s needs, helping us address the complexities of expedited transportation and giving us a competitive edge. The work on our TMS platform not only improved how Tri-State operates but also taught me how technology can make a real difference in solving business challenges.

As CIO, I’m committed to continuing this focus on innovation and ensuring Tri-State stays adaptable and prepared for the future. My key priorities include:

Honoring Our Legacy: Staying true to the teamwork, values, and customer focus that have been central to Tri-State’s success.

Driving Innovation: Updating IT systems and processes to improve efficiency, scalability, and service delivery.

Mergers & Acquisitions: Helping Tri-State transition smoothly into the Load1 family while maximizing the benefits of this new partnership.

Managing Risk: Proactively identifying and addressing operational and technology risks to support long-term growth.

Fostering Growth: Using my experiences at both Tri-State and C3D0 to build systems and strategies that keep the company moving forward.

From founding C3D0 to leading IT at Tri-State, my career has always been about solving problems, empowering teams, and building a strong, successful company. I’m excited to keep driving our mission forward, blending the strength of our past with a clear focus on the future.","","1587493","Load One, LLC","1587493","Truck Transportation","Taylor, Michigan, United States","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQGAGY7FuYpl-A/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1687897644244/load_one_llc_logo?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=6HlPzjyJzkq44uPI6tWtytJcfFE0MyflaiI-38fNVls","Load One, LLC","10","2024","6",,"6",,"Chief Information Officer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Chad","Chad Nicholls","Nicholls","Northwood, Ohio, United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ACwAAAKpDa0BIVKzWowEDLbKKdgCJlXP2uoWRns","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQHqvWwONtr-jg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1731001089861?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=Lx5dPrOlmtPm83CywFOCVWRot_OPe1OEtI0mNmsF2XU","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAAAKpDa0BIVKzWowEDLbKKdgCJlXP2uoWRns,NAME_SEARCH,ggmQ"

"Information Technology practitioner with over 25 years experience, no matter work or play technology drives me. Throughout my career I have consistently proven able to hit the ground running, developing high performing technology teams, inspiring others and producing exceptional results. I have a strong track record of creative problem solving; the following is just one of many tales of technology.

While operating a local data center a lightning strike knocked out a phase in the electrical delivery system and arc welded the generator transfer switch into a neutral position. An electrical technician was not available for roughly 8 hours. I ran down to the local hardware store purchased enough extension cords to power our PDU's and had our systems back online within the hour.

From home, the office, to the cloud I am deeply invested in providing an answer to any outside the box problem as quickly as possible.

In my current position is held in the fintech space, I developed and executed a plan across multiple teams and business units to migrate our physical data center to AWS services. This required rearchitecting our core platform to work with cloud system and best practices while maintaining SOC I & II as well as PCI compliance. Utilizing terraform my team and I were able to fully migrate all assets in under six months decreasing overall spend by nearly one million dollars annually and increasing system availability to 99.99% service levels.

My favorite work project was migrating our on-prem Microsoft Active Directory services to a Cloud Directory provider JumpCloud. I was able to integrate JumpCloud with Google Workspaces, local workstations, cloud infrastructure, internal applications and vendor software using SAML, RADIUS, and LDAP services to reduce user provisioning and deprovisioning to just a few clicks.","","33516651","ampliFI Loyalty Solutions (formerly Augeo FI)","33516651","Financial Services","Naperville, Illinois, United States","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQFKap1fTc7W8Q/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1696949696750/amplifiloyalty_logo?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=ia6gJFC0u6uwa5t3alXenAmQsBDMeWam5Hyx991Romk","ampliFI Loyalty Solutions","9","2009","7","15","7","15","Director Information Technology Infrastructure",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Peter","Peter Lasky","Lasky","Naperville, Illinois, United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ACwAAAFC0PABBa_VBLc6rylG-VdQQ92ZRNbbte8","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQGThzycegKnWg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1555518025587?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=To5IZz_nmNQNXTM-UU-AtITW5PnogJYcU_B1dlWQhig","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAAAFC0PABBa_VBLc6rylG-VdQQ92ZRNbbte8,NAME_SEARCH,TBmc"

"Phil is the Practice Director for Modern Datacenter at XenTegra, based in Charlotte, NC, with over 20 years of industry experience.   Modern Datacenter realizes that customers don't live within the four walls of an on-prem datacenter - but rather that hybrid multi-cloud is the way IT is delivered.  Modern Datacenter at XenTegra encompasses both on-prem, hybrid and hyper-scale cloud in the practice.  

Phil loves solving complex, technology problems by breaking down the impossible into tangible achievements - and by thinking two or three steps ahead of where we are today.  He has spent most of my career as an infrastructure technologist in hands-on roles, even while serving as a leader.  His perspective is one of servant leadership, working with his team to build something greater collectively. 
 Having been lucky to have many opportunities and doorways opened during his career - Phil has a diverse background as a programmer, a writer, an analyst all while staying grounded in infrastructure technology.","2 recent posts on Linkedin","6413594","XenTegra","6413594","IT Services and IT Consulting","Charlotte, North Carolina, United States","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQHOKRaBjokKlQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1689783115654/xentegra_llc_logo?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=v3tPYPfE4MRL5MUOb9CRVbZeNtyEUGoDwqHn4EwcKFI","XenTegra","1","2024","5","2","3","1","Practice Director, Modern Datacenter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Philip","Philip Sellers","Sellers","Charlotte Metro",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ACwAAABrnhEBEleEc5cPbt7lM8iVR4OZfu1RYgY","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQF7qd6ZqHwLmQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1715710323559?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=dlcrTNdyQYNK0-OyjuwYdvpHXp4NzzVyHMaHxwCrK1Q","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAAABrnhEBEleEc5cPbt7lM8iVR4OZfu1RYgY,NAME_SEARCH,n8x0"

"Over the last decade+ I bootstrapped a series of VC media and education products and businesses alongside my 20K+ subscriber VC newsletter and blog which gets 1 million+ page views per year. 

Subscribers to my newsletter hail from startups, enterprises, and VC firms including household names like Scale Venture Partners, Greylock, and Bessemer. (If you'd like to learn more about our audience: passionfroot.xyz/venture5-media)

I also co-founded the VC education program GoingVC, which has 500+ members and alumni worldwide, many of whom are employed at top VC firms including Upfront Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, and 500 Startups.

Last, I'm an active angel investor and advisor. Personally and through GoingVC Partners(which I co-founded), I've invested in 20+ early stage companies, (3 profitable exits and 1 🦄  so far). Investors in startups I've invested in or advise include institutional VC firms like Bain Capital Ventures, Insight Venture Partners, and Boldstart.
 
Previously I spent 6 years at DigitalOcean, including 3 years within the DigitalOcean Marketplace (200+ Apps and Partners) where the product exceeded annual revenue goals and during a time which DigitalOcean experienced a successful 2021 IPO. As Director of the Marketplace reporting to DigitalOcean's Chief Product Officer, I led a cross-functional team of ~20 Product Managers, Partner Managers, and Engineers.

Earlier in my career, I did product management and product marketing work with Amazon and AWS, technical consulting and architecture with companies like VMware and FOXSports.com, and was the 1st business hire at Turbonomic (recently acquired by IBM for a reported $2 billion).

No plan is successful without the right people, processes and technologies in place to execute. While I’ve developed strategies and plans to build and transform processes and infrastructure, it’s been the work of high-performance cross-functional teams where change was created. I consider it a privilege to build, tool and lead these teams through every aspect of the change management cycle as we transform infrastructure, upgrade systems and applications, develop cloud-based solutions, improve IT services delivery and build out enterprise security and risk management solutions.

"In my role as ERP Systems Integration Analyst, I used my years of experience understanding the full scope of information systems architecture & design, data flows, and application development in order to support continued business operations from various M&A target opportunities.

As an IT Director in the construction industry, I helped define future direction as it relates to technology systems, security best practices, technology vendors, office & field staff needs, IT team structure, and operations and finance data analytics to support new bids and business operations.

As the Director of Software Development, I lead a team of developers & managed offshore teams and other vendor relationships dedicated to our data products.

During my years in a developer role, I had the opportunity to be immersed in cloud development on platforms like Microsoft Azure & Amazon Web Services (AWS) & have been doing that since 2010.  I've also been involved with the mobile space by developing for the iOS & Android app stores or integrating our products & proprietary data with the Salesforce ecosystem.

Along the way, I picked up valuable experience using the Agile methodology & project management - utilizing sprints, Scrum boards, continuous deployment, continuous integration, automated unit testing, application performance monitoring (APM) and observability principles, etc.

In my past positions, I wore many hats & enjoy all technologies in general, & all my experience has given me a cross-platform background, which makes me diverse in terms of the skill set I can offer. 

I am a self-starter & self taught developer - .NET, Cloud, mobile, ORM, Nodejs, jQuery, etc. I got my start as a junior .NET developer, I moved up to a Lead Developer & Project Manager for a few ongoing initiatives & product release cycles.

My passions & interests are in all areas of technology, but in particular, anything directly related to online or web technologies (i.e. wire-framing, user-interface design, web accessibility, usability).  If you've ever read or can appreciate Zeldman's ""A List Apart"" - www.alistapart.com  - then you know where I'm coming from with design.

I've had hands-on learning experiences with a wide range of technologies in my professional career. My past positions have given me cross-platform experience with greater understanding of network & computing system interactions in general. To that end, I consider myself to have achieved full stack developer status & comfortable serving in system architect role as well.","","98415333","Fusable","98415333","Data Infrastructure and Analytics","Tuscaloosa, Alabama, United States","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQEwFL3XqfsxQA/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1705401301523/fusabledata_logo?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=SV06_jazG1AiBrzGzkQ-l9TmEwScCCQd1rvkPQw1i_s","Fusable","10","2024","3","1","6",,"Director of Enterprise Applications",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Adam","Adam W.","W.","Matthews, North Carolina, United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ACwAAALCffwBZ3SEfkfJ-jtBjV5mqS4if4cBuiI","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQEKgcyvtM5vYA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1642799252324?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=Ae-IC9CWvEMZSevqKtirFl21kXHStwqc55mo-uIy8TI","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAAALCffwBZ3SEfkfJ-jtBjV5mqS4if4cBuiI,NAME_SEARCH,54HR"

"I am passionate about building outstanding teams to solve big problems and deliver exceptional customer experiences.  That passion has driven me to pursue the IT Platform space, which has been primed for digital transformation through an explosion of innovative technologies and methodologies over the past several years.  In my role at Quantum Health, I led a year-long strategic initiative to deliver new software deployment and container orchestration platforms, enabling our software engineers to leverage CI/CD, Kubernetes clusters, automated testing, and many microservices in AWS created through Terraform infrastructure-as-code.  These platforms have empowered developers to deliver value to the business in minutes rather than weeks, increasing deployments per month by nearly 100x.

It all starts with people and culture.  These dazzling new technologies need to be brought to life by a talented team that is set up for success.  I love to empower teams by creating an autonomous, flexible, and collaborative environment that brings out the best in each of them. I am passionate about continuous improvement, creating win-win scenarios, building strong relationships, and finding solutions that deliver the greatest value.

"I thought I needed a new career – what I really needed was a mission…

For years, I had felt the pull to leave IT, thinking I needed a fresh start in a different field. But after I joined the nonprofit world with the Kimbell Art Museum, I quickly realized that my passion for technology was not the problem; what I needed was a shift to organizations driven by purpose, where technology could play a meaningful role in supporting a larger mission. That’s when I discovered the transformative power of working with nonprofits and educational institutions – and I have never looked back.

With over 20 years in mission-driven sectors, I bring both strategic vision and hands-on technical expertise to organizations seeking impactful digital transformation. From leading cloud migrations and CRM implementations to crafting data governance frameworks, security protocols, compliance policies, and disaster recovery plans, I guide cultural and educational institutions in building secure, reliable technology that protects our data and drives our mission forward.

One accomplishment I’m especially proud of is leading a full-scale cloud migration at the Kimbell Art Museum, which improved data accessibility and streamlined operations, empowering staff to work more efficiently and securely. Additionally, I implemented a comprehensive disaster recovery and data governance framework that has since become a standard for safeguarding critical information and ensuring resilience across the organization.

Whether developing policy, leading and mentoring a team, or providing hands-on technical support, I work to create secure environments where technology fosters both organizational growth and trust. I am passionate about connecting with organizations that view IT as a strategic partner in achieving their vision. If you are looking to leverage technology to drive purpose and impact, let’s connect – I would love to explore how we can make that happen.","Recently hired, 1 recent post on Linkedin","56989","Space Center Houston","56989","Museums, Historical Sites, and Zoos","Houston, Texas, United States","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQGGYD_V3znCfg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1666097947587/space_center_houston_logo?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=L86fcXkyUj2TqES2u2XcCxGMGtJxSPERaL0c9ehVSXo","Space Center Houston","3","2025","1",,"1",,"Vice President of Technology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Brian","Brian Whaley","Whaley","Fort Worth, Texas, United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ACwAACIVuhMBZMPhqcJbiLyL973BjOviBjBhCOs","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQFzxyQHTtbwhQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/B56ZPjM5YwGQAg-/0/1734683629442?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=p6BbYHCmXEVhG-3JdKeKPwW90vw47ihnu_GrwYYIOWw","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAACIVuhMBZMPhqcJbiLyL973BjOviBjBhCOs,NAME_SEARCH,kN1u"

"I can fly a plane, teach skiing, run marathons, sing, and make guacamole for 400 people, not because I'm talented...  

It's because I'm curious. 

I ask myself, ""How does she do that?""  ""I wonder if I can do that?""  ""How does that work?""  ""Can I learn that?"" 

Curiosity led me to technology 25 years ago and I'm constantly challenged to learn and grow. I thrive in bringing order out of chaos and ushering in effective solutions that bring stability and value to organizations.

I believe success is a product of people and process, and I focus on building the right processes where people can build and grow an organization to its fullest potential. 

I love building relationships, communicating with all levels of the business, and mentoring team members toward excellence. I'm fortunate to have opportunities that lead change and transformation.  I grow teams toward long-term success while promoting a positive management culture. 

I enjoy seeing others succeed, and although I don't mind the spotlight, I'm happier when sharing it with others. There's nothing more powerful than the shared success of teamwork!

I've built an excellent record of leading projects and initiatives to deliver exceptional results.  I've recruited, lead, and motivated cross-functional teams determined to attain shared objectives and collective vision.  For the last several years, I've focused in healthcare IT, delivering security, high availability and real-time solutions to clients.

"¡Hola mundo! My name is Miguel Carranza and I am a software engineer from Seville, Spain. I got my first computer when I was 8 years old and I fell in love with technology. Since that moment, the decision to study Computer Science was pretty settled. Afterward, I was fortunate enough to receive a scholarship to take an MSc in Software Engineering at Cranfield University.

Right after graduating from my masters, my life dream of working in Silicon Valley became a reality. Thanks to the program Jovenes con Futuro, I got an internship at MindSnacks, an educational software company in San Francisco. I became a full-time employee soon, and the original 6-month plan ended up turning into 5 and a half amazing years. The experience was phenomenal, I got to work with an incredibly talented team, learned way more than I ever thought was possible, and helped building Elevate, which became Apple’s App of the Year of 2014.

In 2018, I left my job as a Director of Engineering at Elevate to start a new company with my friend Jacob. RevenueCat, the easiest way for app developers to implement mobile subscriptions, launched that summer. We also went through Y-Combinator, and learned from world-class founders.

Currently, I serve as RevenueCat’s CTO. Our team is distributed and our engineers are based in 10 countries and multiple timezones.

Besides computers and learning about company building mistakes, I love surfing, playing guitar/bass, photography and videography. I am also a big fan of Star Wars, pizza, Cool Ranch Doritos and Californian punk-rock. 

I am always excited to have healthy discussions about my interests, analyzing pros and cons, and being constantly learning. Please reach out if you strongly disagree with anything I write here, or if I can be of any help.","1 mutual connection, 1 recent post on Linkedin","18697746","RevenueCat","18697746","Software Development","San Francisco, California, United States","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHXjJJQR7_eFA/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1631433653938/revenuecat_logo?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=DV1cgZzEYRd0URwYmV7SD2r9Vap0cVARsWTByxVKV3Q","RevenueCat","9","2017","7","7","7","7","CTO & co-founder",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2","Miguel","Miguel Carranza Guisado","Carranza Guisado","Encinitas, California, United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ACwAAAVOiKwBLn0S6vAUyQ--Pp3cPct2jddSqs8","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5603AQFwZvg4YqUnoA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1609448709722?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=4gYBzyPw-9KeE_D5BzBKwri9JI5AScbaGJnPzN29pts","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAAAVOiKwBLn0S6vAUyQ--Pp3cPct2jddSqs8,NAME_SEARCH,wZHQ"

"I’ve spent most of my career as a software developer, typically somewhere in the financial space.  Writing software is something that I just enjoy.  I do it in my spare time to relax and to keep my mind sharp.  I love the challenge of solving problems with computers.

On the technical side, I’ve been a Microsoft Stack guy from the beginning of my career; C#, ASP.Net, SQL Server, but I’ve done c++ and Oracle in the past.  I’m not graphical, so I tend to do most of my work on the server side.  I can do front end work, using JavaScript, Angular and React, but I do better if there is someone to make things look pretty.  If you want black text on a white background, I’m your guy.  If you want something pretty, you probably want someone with UI skills.  For the record, I know what looks good, I just don’t know how to make something look good.  I’m also working with Python, Go, AWS, Azure, and I own too many Raspberry Pis running everything from simple web servers to a Kubernetes cluster.

I have now transitioned to a software architecture role, which presents its own set of challenges, but its own set of rewards that go with that.

Along the way, I’ve managed teams multiple times and this continues to be a true passion.  I love mentoring developers and helping guide them to be the best that they can be.  People entering the workforce today will be the leaders of tomorrow and giving them a boost only helps everyone.  I will never forget the people who helped to mentor me early in my career and I want to pass that on to the leaders of tomorrow.","Recently hired, 2 recent posts on Linkedin","74103622","ControlExpert, a solvd group company","74103622","Claims Adjusting, Actuarial Services","Southlake, Texas, United States","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQF6c_zMoUuQRQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1738090336440/controlexpert_solvd_logo?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=exiJGIomD60vY3re5Q_RBlhhZg0Bk1hd69c1uElFSOI","ControlExpert, a solvd group company","3","2025","1",,"1",,"Vice President of Technology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Michael","Michael Knox","Knox","McKinney, Texas, United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ACwAAAAQVpEBgMpeBRA-VLIpRRXNnqvZ_ceE9Y0","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5603AQGFGHb3sFbCVg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1659653132752?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=e50jWjn7YH89j46fnTaHxFkMubzoAwEnrGfK5RgOeqY","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAAAAQVpEBgMpeBRA-VLIpRRXNnqvZ_ceE9Y0,NAME_SEARCH,2w70"

"I’m an engineer with a passion for building teams and foundational components that enhance the reliability, scalability, and performance of core mobile-first systems. I thrive on the challenge of creating teams and companies from the ground up—scaling from zero to IPO—and transforming them into scalable, secure, and impactful organizations. I love getting my hands dirty and working directly on technical challenges while delivering results in high-stakes environments. I have a background in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and I see myself leading engineering, product, and design teams around large-scale critical infrastructure in the future.

Currently, I'm the Head of Infrastructure at Pomelo, a fintech company on a mission to expand financial access and empowerment for immigrants and their families. Pomelo is proud to be the first platform to combine consumer credit and global remittances through a mobile app, fostering financial inclusion by helping customers leverage credit instead of cash. I joined Pomelo pre-launch and have been part of our journey as the team more than tripled in size to around 70 members, now based in our San Francisco headquarters and around the world. Pomelo has successfully raised $35M in a Series A round led by Vy Capital, bringing total funding to $55M in equity and securing an additional $125M in warehouse financing. Our notable investors include Founders Fund, A* Capital, and artists such as The Chainsmokers and The Weeknd.

Before Pomelo, I was at AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP), a mobile ads company, for over four years, where I was an Engineering Manager for the Infrastructure team. I led several initiatives related to compute, traffic, and storage from the early stages of the company, building a team from the ground up through hyper-growth and eventual IPO on April 15, 2021 at $28.6B valuation backed by KKR; creating one of the largest mobile ad networks in the industry with 150+ gigabits/sec of traffic and 410M+ daily active users.

I began my career at Zycada, a startup in the CDN space, where I focused on solving the challenges around last-mile content delivery for mobile apps. I played a pivotal role in growing the company, securing $2M in seed funding and $10.5M in Series A funding, totaling $12.5M. These efforts culminated in Zycada’s Series B funding of $19M, bringing total funding to $31.5M, and acquisition by Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW), marking a significant milestone in both the company’s journey and my own career.

"I’m a passionate leader, practitioner, and author focused on using cloud native Platform Engineering to improve business results. I specialize in supporting enterprise adoption of cloud native capabilities, driven by platform engineering. My day-to-day involves delivering thought leadership, client workshops, and advisory services to clients in areas like DevOps, cloud architecture, microservices, data platforms, SecOps, compliance and containerized workloads with Docker and Kubernetes.

In March 2019, I published my book, Mastering Docker Enterprise (Packt Publishing), drawing from my experience as a Docker-accredited consultant and Docker Certified Associate while working with Docker’s professional services teams. I also contribute to the Mirantis (Docker) Training organization as an accredited instructor and adviser.

In 2023, I joined the IEEE DevOps Standards group, where I currently advocate for the platform engineering discipline, contributing to the development of industry standards and best practices.

At nvisia, I lead DevOps and Cloud efforts, blending cloud architecture with cloud native technologies—think containers, microservices, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes platforms. My approach follows a crawl-walk-run adoption strategy, establishing DevOps fundamentals across enterprise app dev, automation, DevSecOps, and infrastructure teams using agile principles.

I’m a regular presenter at regional tech events, including Prodcon Chicago/Milwaukee, Milwaukee Tech Showcase, Docker Chicago, and Docker Milwaukee meetups, where I share insights and connect with the community. Additionally, I frequently author blog post and LinkedIn articles to help leaders understand and embrace critical nuance related to DevOps and Platform Engineering. 

I hold a B.S. in Computer Engineering from the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE), where I stay involved by supporting their DevOps curriculum and serving on the Software Engineering Advisory Board.

Outside of work, I cherish family time and love learning new stuff. My personal distractions include:

Creative pursuits: Ambitious home improvement projects, rebuilding engines, and guitar
Outdoor adventures: Skiing, wake surfing, motorcycles, and off-road fun
Nerdy hobbies: Raspberry Pi projects for home security and automation

"I am a passionate technologist with over 25 years of experience in Information Technology. During this time, I have acquired experience in nearly all facets of the IT Industry, including desktop support, networking, software development, infrastructure and operations, cloud operations, DevOps, security, and data engineering. I have held various leadership positions over the years, overseeing teams of various sizes in disparate geographic locations. I love tackling challenging problems and working with a team to solve them. I am happiest when I see the team succeed and enjoy the fruits of their success. If the team fails, I don’t hesitate to be the voice of the team and take ownership of any shortcomings.

I have an innate ability to visualize complex, interdependent systems in a way that allows me to understand those systems down to the finest detail. I can communicate those details to technical and non-technical peers in a way that each party can easily understand. I constantly refresh my knowledge and exposure to ensure that I understand today's “art of the possible” and work to find ways to bring that art into reality. 

I believe that Technology, when properly employed, truly does make our lives easier. Conversely, when improperly employed, technology can easily ensnare us in an endless cycle of disruption, troubleshooting, patching, and praying. Technology should work for us, not the other way around.","Shared groups","12952951","Leap Orbit","12952951","IT Services and IT Consulting","Columbia, Maryland, United States","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQFe9nr4P2xiwQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1631341378739?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=qjQ8HhL2oO7fusLujGinS6REhmhfSWo0Uq3sBofBEYY","Leap Orbit","4","2024",,"1",,"1","Director Technology Operations and Security",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Sage","Sage McEnery","McEnery","Greater Tampa Bay Area",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ACwAAAEAAZYB4948zM19wSnNBEsyOXoAqAhdiDw","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQHT5ph5QkRWlQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1517756656439?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=tG2s80ADwNAant0Pa0WxlrVHIcPReOt0T5VHaNTs6iQ","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAAAEAAZYB4948zM19wSnNBEsyOXoAqAhdiDw,NAME_SEARCH,cL7W"

"With over 15 years of experience in the IT sector, I am a strategic technology leader who thrives at the intersection of infrastructure, cloud environments, cybersecurity, and enterprise data management. My expertise spans both high-level strategy and hands-on execution, ensuring that IT investments drive operational efficiency, security, and innovation.

I have worked extensively within private equity-backed organizations, aligning IT strategy with investor-driven objectives. Notably, I have collaborated with multiple KKR-backed portfolio companies—both as vendors and strategic partners—to support and enhance the IT, cybersecurity, and data infrastructure of one of their real estate investments. This experience has deepened my ability to implement industry-leading security frameworks, optimize enterprise data ecosystems, and ensure IT governance meets the rigorous standards expected by institutional investors.

My data expertise includes leading Snowflake-based data warehouse initiatives, integrating multiple third-party sources to enhance business intelligence, reporting, and executive decision-making. Beyond core IT leadership, I am actively expanding into artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLMs), and intelligent document processing, applying these emerging technologies to streamline operations, improve data-driven insights, and fortify cybersecurity strategies.

I am passionate about building scalable, future-ready IT architectures that not only support but accelerate business growth. Whether enhancing cybersecurity resilience, optimizing cloud infrastructure, or leveraging AI for efficiency, my goal is to ensure IT serves as a strategic enabler for success in dynamic, high-growth environments.","Recently hired","96410233","Cruise Terminals International ","96410233","Maritime Transportation","London, England, United Kingdom","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQGvkoyRXajnsw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1688216090374/cruise_terminals_international_llc_logo?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=DWu024smvDv7mHzZKeDrTfFQrOGbAvUeYW2zPVxIHmI","Cruise Terminals International ","1","2025","3",,"3",,"IT Director",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Armando","Armando Capote","Capote","Miami, Florida, United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ACwAAAl98c8B1s-PYRmVrSychynDJe9i6ATeOxw","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQHWTY0aeWIsmQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1719872203736?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=JfjxJfkro9IUsTMGkITuTWaKUHL07O8yFRRlqUoxVH0","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/lead/ACwAAAl98c8B1s-PYRmVrSychynDJe9i6ATeOxw,NAME_SEARCH,8PMf"

"A customer’s experience can define the perception of your brand.  Good customer experiences increase customer satisfaction which increase word-of-mouth marketing, good reviews and customer loyalty.  Bad customer experiences can do the opposite.
