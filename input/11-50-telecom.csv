"Emanate Wireless","Emanate Wireless",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"true","Emanate builds solutions that continuously monitor the operation and productivity of key clinical assets at healthcare facilities.  

Emanate's PowerPath Temp solution ELIMINATES expensive loss of pharmaceutical inventory caused by spoilage.    Consider this -- refrigerators typically fail once every 10 years -- so a hospital with 50 pharmacy refrigerators experiences an average of *5* failure events per year.   A slow response to just one of these failure events results in losses approaching a hundred thousand dollars.   Emanate's solution eliminates the need for emergency response to refrigerator failure by providing advanced warning before failure even occurs!   How does it work?  By monitoring both temp and AC power of the refrigeration devices and applying AI, the system detects anomalies such as a laboring compressors and failing defrosters *before* they cause a failure.

Emanate's next generation UCLS (Utilization, Condition, and Location System) ELIMINATES expensive costs associated with over-inventory and service of medical equipment.   Studies have shown that a typical hospital has 25% over-inventory of medical equipment.  As an example, for a 200 bed hospital this extra inventory results in $750K annually in unnecessary Capex and Opex.  Why do hospitals have too much equipment?   Because they have no way to measure actual equipment utilization - and so must guess at optimal inventory levels.  Emanate has created a unique solution that uses sensors and AI Machine Learning to MEASURE the utilization of assets such as pumps monitors, and imaging devices.  This measured utilization feeds data-driven analysis of optimal inventory levels – “How much equipment do we really need, and where?”   Further savings are achieved by optimizing equipment service to be usage-based and condition-based rather than time-based.   Patient safety is also enhanced by detecting field faults requiring service - such as power surges, drops, and failing mechanical components.

● I aggressively restructured the business operations, built financial and human resource systems, started an initiative to reorganize and modernize the IT infrastructure, set aggressive goals, established a comprehensive suite of performances metrics, and hired a Director of Business Development to reignite our sales pipeline.
● Our product is SmartLead, a Lead Management software and services platform. I manage IT Operations, Finance Operations, Human Resource, Call Center, Customer Service, Telephony Systems, Warehouse and Fulfillment.
● I am responsible for the P&L, banking, accounts payables & receivables, collections, payroll, taxes, budgets and forecasting, contracts, facilities, employment policies, employee relations and performance, hiring & termination, vendor management, financial close and leading the monthly financial / operations reviews with our shareholders.
● I evaluated and implemented Power BI to replace internal and client facing embedded reports and dashboards.
● I learned the Power BI and SSRS Report Builder tool by building or re-engineering several dozen complex reports and dashboards using data from SQL Server, Excel, Web sources and XML documents.

Able Device's first commercial offering, SIMbae, is an application engine that enables the hosting and execution of IoT applications on an MNO’s SIM instead of on a discrete embedded CPU dedicated to the application. The MNO’s SIM is a secure, resettable, processor, updatable via standard Over the Air (OTA) technology, making it the ideal location to host and execute all aspects of an IoT application.This approach revolutionizes the connected device architecture of machines and devices in all vertical segments resulting in cost savings, ease of development, future-proofing, and increased application security.","1","2","2015","2","10","2","10","CEO & Founder",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Roger","Roger Dewey","CEO & Founder","Dewey","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAB4rwIBrDyjp4ATeY8dYHE7r45wof3CkxU","https://www.linkedin.com/company/6723711","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AINDUSTRY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A8%2Ctext%3ATelecommunications%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=9PNl7cxBQ1ujpkMn4abDeg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"

Co-Founder, CEO, and CTO. Systems Integrator, Solution Provider, and Product Development. Internally funded.

DigitalGlue specializes in providing leading edge digital video production, storage, and distribution solutions. We design, integrate, and support systems based upon your needs today, yet draw from years of real-world experience to engineer a technology path for tomorrow.

Our team is always ready to accept a challenge. Management has an average of over twenty years’ experience serving the broadcast industry. We led the transition from analog to digital, QPSK to DVB-S2, MPEG-1 to HEVC, SD to UHD, and satellite/cable to OTT. We view ourselves as “technology firefighters” – while others flee, we run into the fire.

In 2002, Tim Anderson and Sean Busby co-founded TBC Integration and DigitalGlue. TBC focused on broadcast and satellite hardware sales and integration services. DigitalGlue provided custom software development to industry leaders for media ingest, content management, targeted distribution, automation, and playout. In recent years, technology has shifted from proprietary hardware to software based CPU/GPU solutions. The importance of our rapid software development expertise has proven vital for us to connect legacy infrastructures into a true digital end-to-end workflow. Looking to the future, we decided to change our name to DigitalGlue. We feel the new company name best reflects our vision in a converging digital video ecosystem.","1","9","2002","7","22","7","22","CEO/CTO",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Tim","Tim Anderson","CEO/CTO","Anderson","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAADAFOkB63c0gE1gy4btB58v3cuTpJLcStg","https://www.linkedin.com/company/310983","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AINDUSTRY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A8%2Ctext%3ATelecommunications%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=9PNl7cxBQ1ujpkMn4abDeg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"

The Converged Effect *+(TCE) for upgrades & improvements is different. It’s not about picking what the market has presented as a perceived best product. It’s not about being left with poor project management & tedious support. These type of relationships are broken. Technology purchases & Provider Decisions are NOT one time research projects.

▶︎ 𝙈𝙄𝙎𝙏𝘼𝙆𝙀𝙎 𝙔𝙊𝙐 𝙒𝙄𝙇𝙇 𝘼𝙑𝙊𝙄𝘿:

▶︎𝙈𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙠𝙚 #1: Analysis by Paralysis... I refer to this as falling into the research black hole. This adds months to your ""To-Do"" List. You don’t know what you don’t know so you miss blind spots that sales reps will never point out.

▶︎𝙈𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙠𝙚 #2: Post-Sale Vendor Mismatch... Leaves you with tedious, slow, & nontechnical support. Too often we get sold some make-believe over hyped company story that is made to cover up network deficiencies.

▶︎𝙈𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙠𝙚 #3: Not testing enough & ending up with QOS problems... Test, trial, test, so you don't end up with 3-5 Years of problems.

▶︎𝙈𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙠𝙚 #4: Bad Quarterbacking... Unforeseen Poor Project Management (Due to No Fault of
Your Own) creates for a painful cut over where issues don't get resolved for months. This comedy of errors makes you look bad & has everyone coming to you with complaints.

▶︎𝙈𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙠𝙚 #5: Missing the End Users... Struggling with end users and failing to gain their engagement, buy-in, & adoption of new technology is not easy. Explaining technical is difficult. I show you how to be their top IT leader so you can create end users that cheer your success.

With a digital-first and omnichannel strategy, SQE is committed to building a portfolio of innovative and patented product to deliver long-term differentiation and profitable growth. 

SwaddleDesigns and Amazing Baby are trusted and loved baby brands featuring patented swaddle sacks, sleeping sacks, swaddle blankets, and layette essentials that new and experienced parents love for style, quality, innovation, and value.

The SwaddleDesigns brand was created by Lynette Damir, RN. Featuring the Omni Swaddle Sack® and Transitional Swaddle Sack® with over 14 patents worldwide, these two award-winning products and our commitment to stylish, quality, essentials have contributed to strong market momentum and sales growth. 

Amazing Baby® brand was created as an Amazon exclusive brand. Recently, Amazon agreed to a non-exclusive relationship. As SwaddleDesigns sister brand, Amazing Baby brand has been launched in US, UK, Italy, Germany, France and Spain. 

In 2024, we launched the Boosties® Hybrid Diaper System featuring Honest® Hybrid Diaper Cover and Boosties Disposable and Reusable Inserts. The best-of-class design is a sustainable solution featuring the patented Pocket-Sling® supporting both reusable and disposable inserts.  It is imperative for innovators to disrupt the $60 billion disposable baby diaper industry and strive to reduce plastic pollution and landfill waste and the related carbon footprint.

As a purpose-driven company with a commitment to quality and innovation, our primary mission is to  help parents make safer choices and reduce risk of SIDS and suffocation. We are honored to be trusted by millions of parents around the world. We are energized knowing that we are making a positive impact, and in many ways, we are just getting started.","1","3","2013","1","12","1","12","Chief Operating Officer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Jeff","Jeff Damir","Chief Operating Officer","Damir","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAJZ1s8BMYTluugX4vTPI7fOX1QNmFruN30","https://www.linkedin.com/company/247545","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AINDUSTRY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A8%2Ctext%3ATelecommunications%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=9PNl7cxBQ1ujpkMn4abDeg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"

","true","I am Building a strong team to run operations, product and technology. 
There are few interesting telecom disruption waves such as legacy voice, data to IMS/VoLTE, packet core, traditional RAN to OpenRAN and now the most recent one is the cloud native transformation of the telecom infrastructure, edge and 5G. I led the softswitch transition with SS7 at Lucent, legacy voice, data to VoLTE and packet core transition at Starent, founded Parallel Wireless and grew it to be a leader in All G OpenRAN.

To continue on the telecom disruption path, I have decided to start a new venture A5G Networks. I really enjoyed building and growing the team at Parallel Wireless and made many great friends. While I am going to miss the team, I am thrilled about my new journey with A5G Networks. Looking forward to working with the best minds in the industry and drive the 5G disruption. A5G is the trail blazer to create the mobile networks of the future.","1","11","2020","5","4","5","4","Founder, President, Board Member",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Kaitki","Kaitki Agarwal","Founder, President, Board Member","Agarwal","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAABxEpABUSsIF1BMm5sMpgmnukHjAEjgNsI","https://www.linkedin.com/company/69712585","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AINDUSTRY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A8%2Ctext%3ATelecommunications%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=9PNl7cxBQ1ujpkMn4abDeg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"

Tony leverages his detail-oriented expertise in all phases of the strategy, design and sourcing processes to obtain sizable cost reductions in projects for multinational, financial service, brand-name manufacturers and services companies across a range of user-managed and carrier-managed platforms.  These projects increasingly feature SD-WAN, “Internet First” strategies, networking for Cloud, Managed Services and transformational infrastructure initiatives.  Tony provides all critical functions to clients including: complex financial modeling, technical design and solutions support, business case development, strategy development and commercial negotiation.
In particular, Tony has developed many of TC2's tactical and strategic insights into the shifting service platforms that the major global suppliers employ for WAN transport and infrastructure services. These insights have produced many of TC2's key techniques and innovations for cost comparison, benchmarking, and modeling of current and future client networking needs to deliver the optimal mix of price, performance and complexity.  Additionally, Tony has a deep background in telecommunications industry structure and billing platforms, which has assisted clients in significant surcharge, tax, and bill/contract reconciliation issues.

From the beginning, I have sought to lead and grow our business with this in mind. As a result, we have earned the trust and loyalty of our agents and customers.
 
Early Career:
Over the course of my early career, I worked in sales and customer service for a variety of telecom companies. They grew quickly and were acquired, often more than once. Regardless of the company or the carrier, I began to realize that customers could be better served. This observation was the catalyst for launching CRA Telecom, originally known as Cost Recovery Associates, Inc.

Building on our LeBlanc Communications Group history since 1993, and to further add the experience of Tele-Verse Communications since 1980 and IP-Genie since 1968, CCi Voice is our combined identity. We're known as a LOCAL hosted VoIP phone company, with the strength, redundancy and reliability of world-class data centers and our dozens of back-end wholesale telecom carriers, combined with a local staff that cares. We are close enough to come onsite if needed to do installations, training and fix what's wrong, and are available 24/7/365. Finally, we're also the only carrier we know that will proactively tell our customers if they are having voice quality issues (usually because of their local Internet provider), and work to proactively fix those issues if we provided the carrier.

My role in the company is to pick the right professionals, then get the heck out of their way. We are blessed with extremely smart, motivated and dedicated people, six of whom have been with the company for more than 40 years! 

I enjoy looking for the next technology wave to improve our product offerings, continuing our very deep partnerships with our ""best-in-breed"" suppliers and meeting with customers to hear what we could do better. It is evident that we serve not just ""customers,"" but ""raving fans!"" We plan to be “The #1 most loved and respected telecom company in the Northeast!”

Starting in 2005 with an expertise in metamaterials, they used that knowledge to design and create the world’s first large, lightweight, multi-beam RF lenses.  Their unique technology has brought a new age of high-performance and high-capacity antennas to the telecommunications industry.
MatSing provides a range of antennas for all applications (Macro, Events, and Venues) allowing customers to select the correct antenna type based on the number of cell site locations and required capacity.  Each antenna provides multiple independent sectors covering multiple bands, allowing users to have the highest capacity from the fewest locations—up to 48 independent sectors from a single antenna.
The new and unique design of the MatSing antennas provides the best radio frequency signal control in the industry, giving users exceptional RF performance at much lower power.  MatSing lens technology is the perfect fit for 4G, LTE, and 5G, and it is seen as the most cost-effective network densification tool in the industry.","1","5","2020","11","4","11","4","Chief Executive Officer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Bo","Bo Larsson","Chief Executive Officer","Larsson","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAAB8doBTkQ_oT5hs_JVd6yPEP1lhYoyRNY","https://www.linkedin.com/company/864454","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AINDUSTRY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A8%2Ctext%3ATelecommunications%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=9PNl7cxBQ1ujpkMn4abDeg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"

"Murray Consulting Group","Murray Consulting Group",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"true","▶ SUMMARY: As principal, I lead my firm to provide wide-ranging marketing and customer experience services. With initiatives across an ever-expanding range of industries and extended-term engagements, I have brought C-level executive leadership to my clients’ organizations to deliver on powerful initiatives at all stages of the organizational lifecycle. From startups to mature organizations, I help clients achieve their business goals.

An important part of the work has been envisioning, creating, and implementing comprehensive marketing campaigns. These incorporate digital, social media, and contact center elements to attract new customers and capture them with well-considered customer experience strategies. In addition, I have done extensive brand research and development work for clients.

Central to many of these engagements has been the use of the Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey methodology to identify service improvement needs and inform decision-making. With this data-focused approach, I have been successful at helping client organizations achieve dramatic service improvements.

Just like an independent insurance agency can bring you quotations and coverages from multiple insurance carriers, Top Speed Data can find the best solution for your company’s situation.

We don’t work for any one carrier.  We represent over 40 different telecommunications providers so we can find the right solution for your needs.

The process is simple.

Our experienced network design consultant will sit down with you to get an understanding of the way you do business.  We seek to understand where you are and where you are headed.  We then perform a complimentary assessment of your voice, data, and wireless services.   Then we present you with several options and explain each one.

If you like what you see, we can then submit and process all the orders with the carriers and provide you with complete telecom project management.  And we do not charge you a dime.  The carriers compensate us from the sales and direct marketing costs that are already built into the pricing that they would charge you if you were to buy from them direct. 

We specialize in reducing your telecom costs and increasing your network performance at the same time.  We act as your advocate throughout the design, implementation, and billing processes.   We work for you!!

In addition to voice, data, and wireless, we also provide assistance with cloud services, telecom expense management, consolidated billing, network security, disaster recovery, business continuity planning, co-location services, conference services, GPS tracking, satellite, and more.

Today, the licensed service area of CCA’s over 100 carrier members covers more than 95 percent of the nation.

Headquartered in Washington, DC, CCA advocates on behalf of members’ interests and works to educate policymakers on the key issues that impact members’ ability to compete, survive, and thrive.  Currently these issues include automatic data roaming, interoperability throughout the 700 MHz spectrum, Universal Service Fund reform, spectrum policy and licensing issues and handset exclusivity, among others.

Advocating before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the White House and Congress, CCA works to ensure that our members’ voices and views are heard not only by policymakers but also by the media, third parties and throughout the entire wireless industry.","1","8","2013","8","11","8","11","Director",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Danny L.","Danny L.

I wanted to let you know that I have recently left Avaya and have joined a start-up company called All Business Network Specialists (ABNS) which, over the last 18 months the growth has been nothing short of incredible. 

Effective immediately I will be assuming the role of President to help ensure the company's success. I truly enjoyed my time at Avaya, the opportunities and the friendships made.  Now it is time for a new chapter and a new challenge.  In the coming weeks I will be reaching out to you to share what we are doing at ABNS.

I want to thank you in advance for your consideration.

Many thanks,

While I am no retired, from 1984 until being acquired by the Volaris Group in 2019, it was my good fortune to work side-by-side with the talented managers, developers and support staff who have built and evolved a feature-rich end-to-end software suite that is directly responsible for over 200 customer success stories worldwide. Volaris now firmly has the baton and, backed by an exceptional brain-trust and impressive financial strength, is fulfilling the trust that so many many long-term customers have placed in mutual success over the competition. I could not be more proud of the decision to choose Volaris as the keeper of the flame.

I started TurnkeyISP in the spring of 2020 because I didn't think the existing call centers appreciated how important every subscriber call is to an ISP.

TurnkeyISP helps small ISPs provide world-class technical support and customer service with on-demand remote staffing. We hire top-talent from around the world, train them in the ISP industry, and place them with small ISPs across the USA.","1","5","2020","11","4","11","4","Chief Executive Officer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","David","David Dean","Chief Executive Officer","Dean","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAB1JGxQBV_fPToV1e4m0xUdVc8pWVESD7AM","https://www.linkedin.com/company/66371758","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AINDUSTRY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A8%2Ctext%3ATelecommunications%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=9PNl7cxBQ1ujpkMn4abDeg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"

"Taking it to the streets","Taking it to the streets",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"true","Taking it to the streets is a San Francisco based charity dedicated to empowering homeless at risk youth and providing for them to be self sufficient without the help of government programs, handouts, etc.

It's hard to get a job when you screwed up your childhood, have no work experience, can't shower because you don't have access to a shower and have clothes from living on the street. We aim to offer the ability to transform that... get work experiences and references, get clothes to show up for the interview and gain skills to land that job and get your life back on track.

As CFO / Treasurer I've completed going from nothing to incorporation and 501(c)(3) approval in three months.

I've secured structures for financial transparency.

In addition I'm working on the technology to be able to have an efficient donation program and web presence.

Evolution of corporate security:	
1960: We locked the door and went home.
1970: We installed an alarm to alert the police
1980: Cameras have now become common place
1990: Access control was introduced  to provide authorized access to key areas in a facility 
2000: Migration from physical to virtual --- fire walls
Today: a firewall is like putting up a roadblock to stop an enemy but they came by air.

As every aspect of corporate life relies on both public and private networks, Organizations need to take an active and vigilant approach to the who, what, when, where and why that live in their systems. 50 years ago our businesses were open 8:00 to 5:00, we turned the light off and locked the door, we were safe. Today we're open 24/7/365 and our valuables are no longer physically sitting in an office.  As we've come to realize it’s not a question of how, but when, a virtual intruder will arrive. Organizations have an obligation to their investors, employees and customers to safeguard their most valuable assets, Data. An organizations Brand and their Integrity is their true value!

Totogi’s current offering provides CSPs with two solutions – Totogi Charging System and Totogi BSS. 

Totogi Charging System harnesses the power of the public cloud to deliver real-time, webscale charging with unmatched performance (1M TPS and climbing!); intelligent plan design with nearly instantaneous deployment; and AI/ML-driven hyper-personalization at scale. 

Totogi BSS is the world’s first pure cloud, webscale BSS that leverages TM Forum’s Open APIs (all of them by the end of 2021!) to give carriers the agility and flexibility needed to drive more valuable subscriber engagement. 

The Totogi suite of products empowers carriers to acquire new customers, boost NPS, reduce churn, and grow ARPU. Because Totogi products are 100% purpose-built for the public cloud, they deliver unparalleled value at an unbeatable, usage-based price.

The Imagit reach extends both globally and domestically, with over 400 experienced technicians and engineers deployed.  Imagit has the resources to support a vast array of clients and projects. We provide top-notch IT support, offer innovative solutions, and complete complex hardware/software deployments and upgrades.

After 30+ years in healthcare and telecom, and never having been in a leadership / management position, I joined the Imagit team as Director of Customer Solutions, and the very broad set of responsibilities that role has.  

I have several W2 Engineers that report to me and oversee our 1099 contractor program as well.  I support our sales teams for opportunity vetting and scoping, pricing, profitability and development of the BOM (Bill of Materials) and SOWs (Statements of Work) for each job we do for our clients.

While the TLV Charities organization has increased in size, and the number of events, as we have evolved over the years, the focus of our core initiative has never strayed from raising the most exposure awareness and financial support.

“TLV Charities” came from the concern that simply writing a check and forgetting about the genuine need of a cause somehow replaced actual volunteering. While a monetary donation is always important and much appreciated, getting people actively involved in the community is essential to an organization’s prosperity.

The goal of our organization is to give back to the community through fun and creative ways that also help promote and encourage others to become and remain active in their communities.","1","10","2015","6","9","6","9","Executive Board",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Shannon","Shannon Clements","Executive Board","Clements","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAABeijWwB1fYkJ-zX8j8ik8VixcTElD5Dm4A","https://www.linkedin.com/company/10696946","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AINDUSTRY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A8%2Ctext%3ATelecommunications%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=9PNl7cxBQ1ujpkMn4abDeg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"

Our Mission
is to ‘make a difference’ where no one else will, in the lives of those less fortunate than we are. Specifically in Cartagena Colombia this is a place where unemployment is at a staggering 83%. Human beings living in totally unacceptable living conditions, day in and day out. We are here to initiate an example template so to speak. 
Of putting our resources together and showing the world that ‘people helping people’ is what we need more of in this world today. Our foundation is not so 
much about philanthropy, but more a selfless attitude in helping ‘changing lives’. Even if it is just ‘one person at a time.’

IT isn't just about IT anymore...

Telecom isn't just your pbx phone system...

Network security isn't just about deploying a simple SonicWall...

Your IT and Telecom infrastructure are one in the same.  Convergence is here and all your mission-critical systems to include your CRM, ERP, Project Managment, Payment Processes, Customer Care, Telephone, Social Media.  

Uptime is critical.  Latency and downtime is not acceptable.

With ATG you get a trusted advisor to help bring the best solution to the table and a team to help support and manage your firm.  

My team asks the right questions to provide the right solution for firms current and future needs. 

Our solution isn't about just bringing one vendor to the table...our strategy is to bring them all to the table...and not just the local or regional ones...when the bigger giant national ones tend to be more aggressive and cutting edge.

We send your requirements out to all the vendors:  Not only do we shop on price and get them on a level playing field, but we also help discern the marketing jargon and weed out the nonsense.  

We help craft the requirement, we facilitate the solution and, finally, and most importantly, we help support all those services on a day to day basis through our powerful ticketing and 24hour monitoring platform.

In addition to working alongside my incredible team, I proudly hold the position of co-chair for Work Group 1 at O-RAN ALLIANCE. My expertise lies in Architecture, Use Cases, and Slicing, all of which I am deeply passionate about. From the very beginning, I have been at the helm of the O-RAN Architecture team, and I have also made significant contributions to other pioneering projects, including the XRAN forum and the softRAN proof of concept, in collaboration with Sachin Katti and Stanford University.

Overall, I am fully committed to utilizing my expertise and vast experience to achieve the best possible results for all parties involved. Be it my team, our clients, or our stakeholders, I am always seeking innovative ways to push boundaries and challenge the status quo.
