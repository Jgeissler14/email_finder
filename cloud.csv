Many of the benchmarking tests that we have run in the past related to scalability issues. We often get called in to client engagements when cloud data platforms run into limitations that are inherent in the system architecture.

Increasingly, cost per query is becoming more of a concern rather than absolute scalability limits. So, we are becoming FinOps Consultants in addition to Cloud Data Platform experts.","1","7","2019","9","5","9","5","Director,  WinterCorp Cloud Data Warehouse Lab",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Norbert","Norbert Kremer","Director,  WinterCorp Cloud Data Warehouse Lab","Kremer","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAABYjbYBY1e63oFKQifIA9oyB9TCvcpZDmU","https://www.linkedin.com/company/87068","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList((text%3Acloud%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=WsSllHHmS0awehCbqm6p8g%3D%3D"

A former employee recommended Real IT Solutions after a disastrous attempt with a local IT company. Real IT possessed the knowledge to get us out of a tough situation. We now feel we are in good hands and know that a problem will be taken care of quickly and efficiently.

~Amanda Wiley, Bayside Inn and Beachway Resort

“As if it were their own”
Real IT has been consistently responsive. They have a remarkably effective remote presence but don’t hesitate to come on-site when necessary. They anticipate problems and have designed strategies for us to address them. Bottom line: Real IT really treats the IT aspect of our business with the same level of care and attention as if it were their own. With Real IT just an email or phone call away now we’ve saved many hours of down time and frustration.

~Dave Gersten, Lead Engineer, Media Technologies

Technology is the third key challenging area, only after chronic diseases and interdisciplinary care. We are developing a closed system, that leverages natural language understanding (NLU) and large language models (LLMs) for our application and interaction designs, and have augmented this with custom vocabularies, built for purpose models, and human-in-the-loop (HITL), to make our design easy and accessible for our seniors, community partners and internal staff.  
Our closed models are augmented with New Jersey specific information, that we review and update on a daily basis to ensure that the answers provided are accurate, complete, concise, consistent and consumable. Working sometimes as a data scientist, user researcher or user experience architect, I work with various programs, process and policy subject matter experts, to integrate best practices from both public and private sector prior to this information being introduced to the model. We are currently building and testing build a multilingual contact center that can provide near real-time assistance for a non-English-speaking constituent from an English-speaking agent. This extendable user interface and API, will enable the near real time translation services over text and voice, with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with our closed LLMs we are able to provide these multi-language translations to our content management system, other workloads, applications and user interfaces.
We are also implementing intelligent document processing, innovating our case management and constituent services to provide enhanced services to New Jersey's citizens.","1","10","2023","6","1","6","1","Sr Enterprise Architect - Cloud and Contact Centers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Tanya Anne","Tanya Anne Callaway","Sr Enterprise Architect - Cloud and Contact Centers","Callaway","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAD9c1cBNWZp3oyxKe884yCCjNAEH177XOQ","https://www.linkedin.com/company/59663478","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList((text%3Acloud%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=WsSllHHmS0awehCbqm6p8g%3D%3D"

And you should embrace 100% of the functionality the hyperscalers provide. Not build applications that are cloud-agnostic or hybrid, and certainly not deploy on private cloud (#fakecloud), but rather leverage technology that can save you 50% or more on your TCO. How else are you going to pay for your 5G network? And CSPs who embrace this transformation NOW will be the ones who come out on top. Period.  

I will help you sort through the noise, giving you my unfiltered take on what is really happening in the telecom industry when it comes to public cloud – sharing insights every CSP C-level needs to know.

Listen to my new Telco in 20 podcast – give me 20 minutes, and we’ll cover the next 20 years in telco. Get the latest news, insights and best practices on how public cloud is transforming telecom – and enjoy a few laughs! New episodes with fascinating guests drop every two weeks.

And sign up for my FREE Telco in 20 newsletter. Every two weeks, I curate content from the industry and share my insights in an email delivered to your inbox. You’ll find essays, frank conversation, practical tips for leaders, and links to articles that help you keep up with all the happenings in telco and public cloud.

While the TLV Charities organization has increased in size, and the number of events, as we have evolved over the years, the focus of our core initiative has never strayed from raising the most exposure awareness and financial support.

“TLV Charities” came from the concern that simply writing a check and forgetting about the genuine need of a cause somehow replaced actual volunteering. While a monetary donation is always important and much appreciated, getting people actively involved in the community is essential to an organization’s prosperity.

The goal of our organization is to give back to the community through fun and creative ways that also help promote and encourage others to become and remain active in their communities.","1","10","2015","6","9","6","9","Executive Board",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Shannon","Shannon Clements","Executive Board","Clements","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAABeijWwB1fYkJ-zX8j8ik8VixcTElD5Dm4A","https://www.linkedin.com/company/10696946","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList((text%3Acloud%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=WsSllHHmS0awehCbqm6p8g%3D%3D"

Sir Evelyn firmly believed that given the opportunity to know one another personally, people who shared a common language would soon discover that they also shared similar values, whatever their differences in nationality or background. 

Founded in 1920, the English-Speaking Union of the United States is a national membership organization with more than 4,000 members organized in 65 Branches across the country. ESU members and volunteers are the pillars of our educational and cultural programs as they work in their local communities to carry the ESU mission forward. The English-Speaking Union of the United States shares fellowship with more than 50 independent ESUs around the world, including the English-Speaking Union of the Commonwealth in London.

For 100 years, the ESU educational and cultural programs have enriched the lives of American students, teachers, English language learners and ESU members.","1","3","2023","1","2","1","2","Board Member and Finance Committee Chair",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Michelle","Michelle Seale","Board Member and Finance Committee Chair","Seale","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAC1gCQBMVGhcOK8UrBTWVOPbZ33yXUzxr0","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1313367","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList((text%3Acloud%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=WsSllHHmS0awehCbqm6p8g%3D%3D"

Accomplishments:

• Involved leadership with 1000+ individual contributions in FY '23/'24, ensuring both context & knowledge of the infrastructure & transition state in real time
• First ever platform level ATO in Google Cloud for a DoD mission space
• Direct Collaboration w/ DoD CIO ZT PfMO
• Multiple exceptional ""Red Team"" insider threat assessments
• Zero Trust Architecture in GWS & GCP (NIST 800-207 directly collaborating with the DoD CIO ZT PfMO, Google & Mandiant)
• Comprehensive Identity integration w/ DOD Global Directory
• Comprehensive Software & Dependency Supply Chain Security
• Secure, multi-enclave GitOps Deployment
• Secure Build & Release Engineering
• Secure, Independent, API based declarative configuration of Assured Workloads
• Comprehensive Monitoring (NIST 800-207) & Integration w/C5ISR

Not just a Platform.
Monad Creates Virtual Venues for Live Performance & Superfan Monetization.

Monad’s Mission: 
Is to close the gap between the societal value music brings to humanity and the money allocated to it. 
We are doing this for Creators, Copyright Owners, Labels, Venues and to support Mental Health.
 
We curate technologies including Web3, Gaming, Tokenization & AR/XR (without headsets) to provide live performance oriented, long-format, interactive content.

Revenue is generated by fans subscribing, tipping, gamification and purchasing NFTs. 80% of this revenue goes to the Creator.
These virtual venues are called Circles - as a reflection of the ethos of the Monad.

Monad built the World's First ""Dance to Earn"" Virtual Dance Floor App where fans use their mobile device to translate dance movements to their unique avatar and earn fungible tokens that can be used to purchase NFTs and Tip Creators! More tokenization and a fantastical AR Portal Experience coming soon!

An Intimate, Safe, Fun, Authentic Home for Creators and their Fans.

Mental health support. No trolls. No haters.

At the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS), we're embarking on an ambitious journey to revolutionize public health insurance access through the One Health initiative. The goal is to streamline and unify the eligibility and enrollment processes for both MAGI and non-MAGI members, transitioning from the legacy MA21 mainframe system to a modern, modular, and more efficient framework.

Key Responsibilities:

-Project Leadership: Spearheading the technical efforts to migrate the MA21 mainframe system (ADABAS/Natural) to the AWS Cloud. This critical step is foundational for the larger goal of modernizing public health insurance access.
-Strategic Planning: Collaborating in the development of EOHHS's strategic plan. This involves an in-depth analysis of the current Medicaid and MA21 operations, pinpointing areas for innovation and improvement.
-System and Operations Mapping: Leading a comprehensive effort to map and understand the existing Medicaid and MA21 systems and operations, setting the stage for their successful transition to the cloud.
-Technical Architecture Management: Overseeing the implementation of technical solutions across various domains - including business processes, systems integration, hardware, and networking - to ensure a seamless and effective migration of the MA21 system to the AWS Cloud.
-Lead Author of RFQ & RFR for the Rehosting Vendors

Impact:

This initiative marks a pivotal step towards the One Health vision, offering a single point of access for individuals and families seeking public health insurance benefits.

LET'S CHAT - Schedule a call with me: just go to my Calendly and grab a convenient time slot. https:///www.calendly.com/deniswilson. Everyone is worth at least a 15-minute conversation. 

THE 10 HIDDEN RISKS TO YOUR BUSINESS AND THEN 1 FAST WAY TO FIND THEM
1. Wrong keys in the wrong hands - watch network access very carefully, and don't give good employees the opportunity to bring you down,
2. Bring your own headache - using employee's phones can bring real headaches. They are often lost or stolen, along with your emails and documents.
3. Who's knocking on your backdoor? - cloud services like Dropbox and Gmail are cheap and convenient, but each of these connections is just as easy for someone else to access.
4. Weak or available passwords - Are your passwords a year old? Do you flip over your keyboard to get the password? Is your password ""Password1""?
5. Whoa! Back up! - when was your backup image audited? Your backup process audited?
6. Show me the compliance - often the law requires you to protect customer's data and demonstrate compliance or face fines. Especially in California.
7. Update everything - your defenses are only as good as the updates. Are they updated? Are your computers capable of being updated? 
8. ""Ghosts"" in the machines - inactive users and computers that have ghost profiles on your network represent holes that may be hackable.
9. When IT can't keep up, your business goes down - you may have redundancies, but they are only as good as your policies and your people, how often are they tested and trained?
10. Hiding in the dark - lack of vision into the true state of your technology defenses may leave your business vulnerable.

The way you can do all of these is to ask for a Network Assessment - from your favorite computer guy - or have us audit your network AND your computer guy for free. You get to keep the summary report.

Data 360 provides a low-code app development platform as a service to help businesses large and small build their software in the cloud, using AI and machine learning to lower the cost of developing and managing websites, social media, mobile apps, CRM systems, and ERP systems. Our enterprise services also work with organizations in education, healthcare, retail and restaurant industries. Our system can save up to 90% of operational costs for any type of organization.

We have two main services in our development platform, Smart Search and Smart CRM.  Data 360's Smart Search service uses big data, AI and machine learning to replace traditional market research, customer research or any other data-driven information gathering.   Our Smart CRM service provides a matching system using big data, AI and machine learning that helps clients recruit and manage the most appropriate contacts for any operations, HR, marketing or sales goal.

We're solving for the problems of inefficiency and high costs human error and bias in the creation of web, SaaS and mobile based software systems for developing, growing and managing communities (including customers, employees, partners and collaborators).  We're a cloud-based backend system that is a low cost, high value alternative to the high costs of managing these operational processes through traditional web-based platforms, websites and mobile apps, Google ads, Facebook ads, CRM systems and ERP systems.

Our system also creates major positive disruptions for education, healthcare, workforce development, diversity and inclusion (including neurodiversity), work from home (WFH), and human resources (for expanding hiring pipelines).

At Product Genius, we're evolving the concept of observability from systems to people. Just as we once decoded machine data to optimize performance, we now analyze human interactions to drive business success.

* Empower leaders with insights to foster growth and engagement

We're not just gathering feedback—we're creating a new paradigm of organizational understanding. Our AI-driven platform reveals the patterns in human communication that truly matter, enabling leaders to make decisions that resonate with both customers and employees.
By bridging the gap between technical observability and human insight, we're helping businesses create environments where every voice contributes to success. From the front lines to the C-suite, we're turning conversations into your competitive advantage.

Join us in building a future where businesses thrive by truly understanding and responding to the needs of their people—both inside and outside the organization.","1","7","2024","9",,"9",,"Chief Technology Officer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Lee","Lee Atchison","Chief Technology Officer","Atchison","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAARYH8BAQSxA8O88AqwUfBFNwLVP7325rA","https://www.linkedin.com/company/105178762","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList((text%3Acloud%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=WsSllHHmS0awehCbqm6p8g%3D%3D"

Right from the start, the mission was clear: the ambition to be able to bring agile solutions to the enterprise world for the mobilization of data, notoriously segregated within legacy or difficult-to-access systems, with a strong focus on human experience: this is in fact the most important point for us, namely the gratification of the user who benefits from the solutions that the company makes available to him.

It is only with software designed around the person that the person can feel involved in the processes and thus able to unlock more value for the company.

Every year we challenge ourselves by continuously raising the bar of the quality of the services and products we craft, thus embracing new opportunities and crossing different sectors in which to bring our smile and our expertise.

In 2016 we have invented GlueSync, the data replication solutions born to serve the NoSQL world, it is capable of replicating data in real-time from any relational database to Aerospike, Couchbase and MongoDB. Today is being sold across all over the world through an extended network of partners and directly proposed and adopted from major NoSQL database vendors.  

In June 2022 we opened our HQ in North America, in Cupertino, CA in the center of the Silicon Valley area.

MOLO17 is now recognized as the partner of choice for leading NoSQL database vendors.","1","12","2015","4","9","4","9","Founder & CEO ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-03-21","Daniele","Daniele Angeli","Founder & CEO ","Angeli","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAu6C28B0otRY8zRYTO_QIgPSpB6igERM_Q","https://www.linkedin.com/company/10414093","https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A4274772314%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3A11-50%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A320%2Ctext%3AOwner%2520%252F%2520Partner%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A310%2Ctext%3ACXO%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103644278%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520States%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACURRENT_TITLE%2Cvalues%3AList((text%3Acloud%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3Acloud)&sessionId=WsSllHHmS0awehCbqm6p8g%3D%3D"

In addition to working alongside my incredible team, I proudly hold the position of co-chair for Work Group 1 at O-RAN ALLIANCE. My expertise lies in Architecture, Use Cases, and Slicing, all of which I am deeply passionate about. From the very beginning, I have been at the helm of the O-RAN Architecture team, and I have also made significant contributions to other pioneering projects, including the XRAN forum and the softRAN proof of concept, in collaboration with Sachin Katti and Stanford University.

Overall, I am fully committed to utilizing my expertise and vast experience to achieve the best possible results for all parties involved. Be it my team, our clients, or our stakeholders, I am always seeking innovative ways to push boundaries and challenge the status quo.

Initial overhead costs crippled business ability to scale at an enterprise level. Before anyone even worried about open source licensing issues with corporate/compliance, the teams were hard at work with bleeding edge technology to deliver results in time never seen before. Creating unstructured data into a product that created value for the end-client. The ability to take an idea from paper to ""working"" prototype in 6-12 hours was nearly unheard of back then, where today it is a necessity.

Collaboration across Adobe stakeholders including product teams as well as horizontal teams from privacy, security, cloud operations, finance and accounting.

Successfully led over 10 complex cloud initiatives, consistently delivering projects on time and within budget with a 95% success rate. By aligning project goals with overall business strategy, I ensured maximum value creation and operational efficiency.

With a deep understanding of cloud financial operations (FinOps), implemented effective cost management strategies that reduced cloud spending by 25% while maintaining performance and reliability.
